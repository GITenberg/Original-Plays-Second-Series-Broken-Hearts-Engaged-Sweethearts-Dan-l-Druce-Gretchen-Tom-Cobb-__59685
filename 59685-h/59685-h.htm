and a bit o’ poachin’ now and again; and what wi’ my illicit
whusky still&mdash;and throwin’ trains off the line, that the poor
distracted passengers may come to my cot, I’ve mair ways than
one of making an honest living&mdash;and I’ll work them a’ nicht

<p><i>Mrs. Mac.</i> D’ye ken, Angus, I sometimes think that thou’rt
losing some o’ thine auld skill at upsetting railway trains.
Thou hast not done sic a thing these sax weeks, and the cottage
stands sairly in need of sic chance custom as the poor delayed
passengers may bring.</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Nay, mither, thou wrangest him. Even noo, this very
day, has he not placed twa bonnie braw sleepers across the up-line,
ready for the express from Glaisgie, which is due in twa
minutes or so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mac.</i> Gude lad! Gude thoughtfu’ lad! But I hope the
unfortunate passengers will na’ be much hurt, puir unconscious
bodies!</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Fear nought, mither. Lang experience has taught me
to do my work deftly. The train will run off the line, and the
traffic will just be blocked for half a day, but I’ll warrant ye
that, wi’ a’ this, nae mon, woman, or child amang them will
get sae much as a bruised head or a broken nose.</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> My ain tender-hearted Angus! He wadna hurt sae
much as a blatherin’ buzzin’ bluebottle flee!</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Ang.</i> Nae, Meg, not if takin’ care and thought could help
the poor dumb thing! (<i>Wiping his eyes.</i>) There, see, lass (<i>looking
off</i>), the train’s at a standstill, and there’s nae harm done.
I’ll just go and tell the puir distraught passengers that they
may rest them here, in thy cot, gin they will, till the line is
cleared again. Mither, get thy rooms ready, and put brose i’
the pot, for mebbe they’ll be hungry, puir souls. Farewell,
Meg; I’ll be back ere lang, and if I don’t bring ’ee a full half-dozen
o’ well-paying passengers, thou may’st just wed the red-headed
exciseman!</p>

honest lad!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mac.</i> Meg, thine auld mither’s hairt is sair at the
thought o’ losin’ ye, for hitherto she’s just been a’ the world to
’ee; but now thou’lt cleave to thine Angus, and thou’lt learn
to love him better than thy puir auld mither! But it mun be&mdash;it
mun be!</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Nay, mither, say not that. A gude girl loves her
husband wi’ one love and her mither wi’ anither. They are
not alike, but neither is greater nor less than the ither, and
they dwell together in peace and unity. That is how a gude
girl loves.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mac.</i> And thou art a gude girl, Meg?</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> I am a varra gude girl indeed, mither&mdash;a varra, varra
gude girl!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mac.</i> I’m richt sure o’ that. Well, the puir belated
passengers will be here directly, and it is our duty to provide
for them sic puir hospitality as our humble roof will afford. It

<p><i>Bel.</i> (<i>leading him off</i>). My friend, we would be alone, this
maiden and I. Farewell! (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Angus</span>, into cottage.</i>) Belinda&mdash;my
own&mdash;my life! Compose yourself. It was in truth
a weird and gruesome accident. The line is blocked&mdash;your
parasol is broken, and your butterscotch trampled in the dust,
but no serious harm is done. Come, be cheerful. We are safe&mdash;quite
safe.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Safe! Ah, Belvawney, my own own Belvawney&mdash;there
is, I fear, no safety for us so long as we are liable to be
overtaken by that fearful Major to whom I was to have been
married this morning!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Major McGillicuddy? I confess I do not feel comfortable
when I think of Major McGillicuddy.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> You know his barbaric nature, and how madly
jealous he is. If he should find that I have eloped with you
he will most surely shoot us both!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> It is an uneasy prospect. (<i>Suddenly.</i>) Belinda, do you
love me?</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> With an impetuous passion that I shall carry with
me to the tomb!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Then be mine to-morrow! We are not far from Gretna,
and the thing can be done without delay. Once married, the
arm of the law will protect us from this fearful man, and we
can defy him to do his worst.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Belvawney, all this is quite true. I love you madly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
passionately; I care to live but in your heart, I breathe but for
your love; yet, before I actually consent to take the irrevocable
step that will place me on the pinnacle of my fondest hopes,
you must give me some definite idea of your pecuniary position.
I am not mercenary, Heaven knows; but business is business,
and I confess I should like a little definite information about
the settlements.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I often think that it is deeply to be deplored that these
grovelling questions of money should alloy the tenderest and
most hallowed sentiments that inspire our imperfect natures.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> It is unfortunate, no doubt, but at the same time it
is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Belinda, I will be frank with you. My income is &pound;1000
a year, which I hold on certain conditions. You know my
friend Cheviot Hill, who is travelling to London in the same
train with us, but in the third class?</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> I believe I know the man you mean.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Cheviot, who is a young man of large property, but
extremely close-fisted, is cursed with a strangely amatory disposition,
as you will admit when I tell you that he has contracted
a habit of proposing marriage, as a matter of course, to
every woman he meets. His haughty father (who comes of a
very old family&mdash;the Cheviot Hills had settled in this part of
the world centuries before the Conquest) is compelled by his
health to reside in Madeira. Knowing that I exercise an all
but supernatural influence over his son, and fearing that his
affectionate disposition would lead him to contract an undesirable
marriage, the old gentleman allows me &pound;1000 a year so
long as Cheviot shall live single, but at his death or marriage
the money goes over to Cheviot’s uncle Symperson, who is now
travelling to town with him.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Then so long as your influence over him lasts, so
long only will you retain your income?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> That is, I am sorry to say, the state of the case.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). Belvawney, I love you with an
imperishable ardour which mocks the power of words. If I
were to begin to tell you now of the force of my indomitable
passion for you, the tomb would close over me before I could
exhaust the entrancing subject. But, as I said before, business
is business, and unless I can see some distinct probability that
your income will be permanent, I shall have no alternative but
to weep my heart out in all the anguish of maiden solitude&mdash;uncared
for, unloved, and alone!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> There goes a noble-hearted girl, indeed! Oh, for the
gift of Cheviot’s airy badinage&mdash;oh, for his skill in weaving a
net about the hearts of women! If I could but induce her to
marry me at once before the dreadful Major learns our flight!
Why not? We are in Scotland. Methinks I’ve heard two
loving hearts can wed, in this strange country, by merely making
declaration to that effect. I will think out some cunning scheme
to lure her into marriage unawares.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> It is well. Stop! Come hither, maiden.</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Oh, sir! you do not mean any harm towards a puir,
innocent, unprotected cottage lassie?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Harm! No: of course, I don’t. What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> I’m but a puir, humble mountain girl; but let me tell
you, sir, that my character’s just as dear to me as the richest

ye, swear to me that you mean me no harm.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Harm? Of course, I don’t. Don’t be a little fool!
Come here.</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> There is something in his manner that reassures me.
It is not that of the airy trifler with innocent hairts. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
What wad ye wi’ puir, harmless Maggie Macfarlane, gude sir?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Can you tell me what constitutes a Scotch marriage?</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Oh, sir, it’s nae use asking me that; for my hairt is
not my ain to give. I’m betrothed to the best and noblest lad
in a’ the bonnie Borderland. Oh, sir, I canna be your bride!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> My girl, you mistake. I do not want you for my bride.
Can’t you answer a simple question? What constitutes a
Scotch marriage?</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Ye’ve just to say before twa witnesses, “Maggie Macfarlane
is my wife;” and I’ve just to say, “Maister Belvawney
is my husband,” and nae mon can set us asunder. But, sir,
I canna be your bride; for I am betrothed to the best and
noblest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

sure.</p>

<p><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Symp."><i>Sym.</i></span> My dear nephew, you would travel third class, and
this is the consequence. After all, there’s not much harm done.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Not much harm? What d’ye call that? (<i>Showing his
hat.</i>) Ten and ninepence at one operation! My gloves split&mdash;one
and four! My coat ruined&mdash;eighteen and six! It’s a
coarse and brutal nature that recognizes no harm that don’t
involve loss of blood. I’m reduced by this accident from a
thinking, feeling, reflecting human being, to a moral pulp&mdash;a
mash&mdash;a poultice. Damme, sir, that’s what I am! I’m a
poultice!</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Cheviot, my dear boy, at the moment of the accident
you were speaking to me on a very interesting subject.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Was I? I forget what it was. The accident has
knocked it clean out of my head.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> You were saying that you were a man of good position
and fortune; that you derived &pound;2000 a year from your bank;
that you thought it was time you settled. You then reminded
me that I should come into Belvawney’s &pound;1000 a year on your
marriage, and I’m not sure, but I rather think you mentioned,
casually, that my daughter Minnie is an Angel of Light.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> True, and just then we went off the line. To resume&mdash;Uncle
Symperson, your daughter Minnie is an Angel of Light,
a perfect being, as innocent as a new-laid egg.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Minnie is, indeed, all that you have described her.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Uncle, I’m a man of few words. I feel and I speak. I
love that girl, madly, passionately, irresistibly. She is my
whole life, my whole soul and body, my Past, my Present, and
my To Come. I have thought for none but her; she fills my
mind, sleeping and waking; she is the essence of every hope&mdash;the
tree upon which the fruit of my heart is growing&mdash;my own
To Come!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> (<i>who has sunk overpowered on to stool during this
speech</i>). Cheviot, my dear boy, excuse a father’s tears. I
won’t beat about the bush. You have anticipated my devoutest
wish. Cheviot, my dear boy, take her, she is yours!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I have often heard of rapture, but I never knew what it
was till now. Uncle Symperson, bearing in mind the fact that
your income will date from the day of the wedding, when may
this be?</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> My boy, the sooner the better! Delicacy would
prompt me to give Belvawney a reasonable notice of the impending
loss of his income, but should I, for such a mere selfish
reason as that, rob my child of one hour of the happiness that
you are about to confer upon her? No! Duty to my child is
paramount!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> On one condition, however, I must insist. This must
be kept from Belvawney’s knowledge. You know the strange,
mysterious influence that his dreadful eyes exercise over me.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> I have remarked it with astonishment.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> They are much inflamed just now, and he has to wear
green spectacles. While this lasts I am a free agent, but under
treatment they may recover. In that case, if he knew that I
contemplated matrimony, he would use them to prevent my
doing so&mdash;and I cannot resist them&mdash;I cannot resist them!
Therefore, I say, until I am safely and securely tied up, Belvawney
must know nothing about it.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Sym.</i> Trust me, Cheviot, he shall know nothing about it

<p><i>Ch.</i> Belvawney, that apostrophe was private; I decline to
admit you to my confidence.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Cheviot, what is the reason of this strange tone of
defiance? A week ago I had but to express a wish, to have
it obeyed as a matter of course.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Belvawney, it may not be denied that there was a time
when, owing to the remarkable influence exercised over me by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
your extraordinary eyes, you could do with me as you would.
It would be affectation to deny it; your eyes withered my will;
they paralyzed my volition. They were strange and lurid eyes,
and I bowed to them. Those eyes were my Fate&mdash;my Destiny&mdash;my
unerring Must&mdash;my inevitable Shall. That time has
gone&mdash;for ever!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Alas for the days that are past and the good that came
and went with them!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Weep for them if you will. I cannot weep with you,
for I loved them not. But, as you say, they are past. The
light that lit up those eyes is extinct&mdash;their fire has died out&mdash;their
soul has fled. They are no longer eyes, they are poached
eggs. I have not yet sunk so low as to be the slave of two
poached eggs.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Have mercy. If any girl has succeeded in enslaving
you&mdash;and I know how easily you are enslaved&mdash;dismiss her
from your thoughts; have no more to say to her; and I will&mdash;yes,
I will bless you with my latest breath!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Whether a blessing conferred with one’s latest breath is
a superior article to one conferred in robust health we need not
stop to inquire. I decline, as I said before, to admit you to my
confidence on any terms whatever. Begone! (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Belvawney</span>.</i>)
Dismiss from my thoughts the only woman I ever loved!
Have no more to say to the tree upon which the fruit of my
heart is growing! No, Belvawney, I cannot cut off my tree
as if it were gas or water. I do not treat women like that.
Some men do, but I don’t. I am not that sort of man. I
respect women; I love women. They are good; they are
pure; they are beautiful; at least, many of them are.</p>

of your own perfection that is, to me, infinitely more charming
than the affected ignorance of an artificial town-bred beauty.</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Oh, sir, can I close my een to the picture that my
looking-glass holds up to me twenty times a day? We see the
rose on the tree, and we say that it is fair; we see the silver moon
sailing in the braw blue heavens, and we say that she is bright;
we see the brawling stream purling over the smooth stanes i’

our een to the fairest of nature’s works&mdash;a pure and beautiful

<p><i>Ch.</i> Then reflect how you are standing in the way of her
prosperity. I am a rich man. I have money, position, and
education. I am a much more intellectual and generally agreeable
companion for her than you can ever hope to be. I am
full of anecdote, and all my anecdotes are in the best possible
taste. I will tell you some of them some of these days, and
you can judge for yourself. Maggie, if she married me, would
live in a nice house in a good square. She would have wine&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>occasionally.
She would be kept beautifully clean. Now, if
you really love this girl almost as well as you love yourself,
are you doing wisely or kindly in standing in the way of her
getting all these good things? As to compensation&mdash;why, I’ve
had heavy expenses of late&mdash;but if&mdash;yes, if thirty shillings&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> (<i>hotly</i>). Sir, I’m puir in pocket, but I’ve a rich hairt.
It is rich in a pure and overflowing love, and he that hath love
hath all. You canna ken what true love is, or you wadna dare
to insult a puir but honest lad by offering to buy his treasure
for money. (<i><span class="smcap">Cheviot</span> retires up.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> My ain true darling! (<i>They embrace.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Now, I’ll not have it! Understand me, I’ll not have it.
It’s simple agony to me. Angus, I respect your indignation,
but you are too hasty. I do not offer to buy your treasure for
money. You love her; it will naturally cause you pain to part
with her, and I prescribe thirty shillings, not as a cure, but as
a temporary solace. If thirty shillings is not enough, why,
I don’t mind making it two pounds.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Nae, sir, it’s useless, and we ken it weel, do we not, my
brave lassie? Our hearts are one as our bodies will be some
day; and the man is na born, and the gold is na coined, that
can set us twain asunder!</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Angus, dear, I’m varra proud o’ sae staunch and true a
love; it’s like your ain true self, an’ I can say nae more for it
than that. But dinna act wi’out prudence and forethought, dear.
In these hard times twa pound is twa pound, and I’m nae sure
that ye’re acting richtly in refusing sae large a sum. I love you
varra dearly&mdash;ye ken that right weel&mdash;an’ if ye’ll be troubled wi’
sic a poor little mousie I’ll mak’ ye a true an’ loving wife, but I
doubt whether, wi’ a’ my love, I’ll ever be worth as much to ye
as twa pound. Dinna act in haste, dear; tak’ time to think before
ye refuse this kind gentleman’s offer.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Ang.</i> Oh, sir, is not this rare modesty? Could ye match it
amang your toun-bred fine ladies? I think not! Meg, it shall
be as you say. I’ll tak’ the siller, but it’ll be wi’ a sair and
broken hairt! (<i><span class="smcap">Cheviot</span> gives <span class="smcap">Angus</span> money.</i>) Fare thee weel,
my love&mdash;my childhood’s&mdash;boyhood’s&mdash;manhood’s love! Ye’re
ganging fra my hairt to anither, who’ll gie thee mair o’ the
gude things o’ this world than I could ever gie ’ee, except love,
an’ o’ that my hairt is full indeed! But it’s a’ for the best;
ye’ll be happier wi’ him&mdash;and twa pound is twa pound. Meg,
mak’ him a gude wife, be true to him, and love him as ye loved
me. Oh, Meg, my poor bruised hairt is well nigh like to break!</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> (<i>looking wistfully after him</i>). Puir laddie, puir laddie!
Oh, I did na ken till noo how weel he loved me!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Maggie, I’m almost sorry I&mdash;poor lad, poor fellow! He
has a generous heart. I am glad I did not curse him. (<i>Aside.</i>)
This is weakness! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Maggie my own&mdash;ever and for always
my own, we will be very happy, will we not?</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Mag.</i> Oh, sir, I dinna ken, but in truth I hope so. Oh, sir,
my happiness is in your hands noo; be kind to the puir cottage
lassie who loves ye sae weel; my hairt is a’ your ain, and if ye
forsake me my lot will be a sair one indeed!</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit, weeping, into cottage.</i></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Poor little Lowland lassie! That’s my idea of a wife.
No ridiculous extravagance; no expensive tastes. Knows how
to dress like a lady on &pound;5 a year; ah, and does it too! No pretence
there of being blind to her own beauties; she knows that
she is beautiful, and scorns to lie about it. In that respect she
resembles Symperson’s dear daughter, Minnie. My darling
Minnie. (<i>Looks at miniature.</i>) My own darling Minnie. Minnie
is fair, Maggie is dark. Maggie loves me! That excellent and
perfect country creature loves me! She is to be the light of
my life, my own to come! In some respects she is even prettier
than Minnie&mdash;my darling Minnie, Symperson’s dear daughter,
the tree upon which the fruit of my heart is growing; my Past,
my Present, and my Future, my own To Come! But this tendency
to reverie is growing on me; I must shake it off.</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Miss Treherne</span>.</i></p>

<p>Heaven and earth, what a singularly lovely girl!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> A stranger! Pardon me, I will withdraw!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> A stranger indeed, in one sense, inasmuch as he never
had the happiness of meeting you before&mdash;but, in that he has a
heart that can sympathize with another’s misfortune, he trusts
he may claim to be regarded almost as a friend.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> May I ask, sir, to what misfortunes you allude?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I&mdash;a&mdash;do not know their precise nature, but that perception
would indeed be dull, and that heart would be indeed flinty,
that did not at once perceive that you are very very unhappy.
Accept, madam, my deepest and most respectful sympathy.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> You have guessed rightly, sir! I am indeed a most
unhappy woman.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I am delighted to hear it&mdash;a&mdash;I mean I feel a pleasure, a
melancholy and chastened pleasure, in reflecting that, if your
distress is not of a pecuniary nature, it may perchance lay in
my power to alleviate your sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Impossible, sir, though I thank you for your respectful
sympathy.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> How many women would forego twenty years of their
lives to be as beautiful as yourself, little dreaming that extraordinary
loveliness can co-exist with the most poignant anguish
of mind! But so, too often, we find it, do we not, dear lady?</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Sir! this tone of address, from a complete stranger!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Nay, be not unreasonably severe upon an impassionable
and impulsive man, whose tongue is but the too faithful herald
of his heart. We see the rose on the tree, and we say that it is
fair, we see the bonnie brooks purling over the smooth stanes&mdash;I
should say stones&mdash;in the burn, and we say that it is beautiful,
and shall we close our eyes to the fairest of nature’s works, a
pure and beautiful woman? Why, it would be base ingratitude,
indeed!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> I cannot deny that there is much truth in the sentiments
you so beautifully express, but I am, unhappily, too well
aware that, whatever advantages I may possess, personal beauty
is not among their number.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> How exquisitely modest is this chaste insensibility to
your own singular loveliness! How infinitely more winning
than the bold-faced self-appreciation of under-bred country girls!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> I am glad, sir, that you are pleased with my modesty.
It has often been admired.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Pleased! I am more than pleased&mdash;that’s a very weak
word. I am enchanted. Madam, I am a man of quick impulse
and energetic action. I feel and I speak&mdash;I cannot help it.
Madam, be not surprised when I tell you that I cannot resist
the conviction that you are the light of my future life, the
essence of every hope, the tree upon which the fruit of my
heart is growing&mdash;my Past, my Present, my Future, my own
To Come! Do not extinguish that light, do not disperse that
essence, do not blight that tree! I am well off; I’m a bachelor;
I’m thirty-two; and I love you, madam, humbly, truly, trustfully,
patiently. Paralyzed with admiration, I wait anxiously,
and yet hopefully, for your reply.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Sir, that heart would indeed be cold that did not
feel grateful for so much earnest, single-hearted devotion. I
am deeply grieved to have to say one word to cause pain to one
who expresses himself in such well-chosen terms of respectful
esteem; but, alas! I have already yielded up my heart to one
who, if I mistake not, is a dear personal friend of your own.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Am I to understand that you are the young lady of property
whom Belvawney hopes to marry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> I am! indeed, that unhappy woman!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> And is it possible that you love him?</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> With a rapture that thrills every fibre of my heart&mdash;with
a devotion that enthralls my very soul! But there’s
some difficulty about his settlements.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> A difficulty! I should think there was. Why, on my
marrying, his entire income goes over to Symperson! I could
reduce him to penury to-morrow. As it happens, I <i>am</i> engaged,
I recollect, to Symperson’s daughter; and if Belvawney
dares to interpose between you and me, by George, I’ll do it!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Oh, spare him, sir! You say that you love me?
Then, for my sake, remain single for ever&mdash;it is all I ask, it is
not much. Promise me that you will never, never marry, and
we will both bless you with our latest breath!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> There seems to be a special importance attached to a
blessing conferred with one’s latest breath that I entirely fail to
grasp. It seems to me to convey no definite advantage of any
kind whatever.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Cruel, cruel man!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Belvawney</span>, in great alarm.</i></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> We are lost!&mdash;we are lost!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Who has lost you?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Major McGillicuddy discovered your flight, and followed
in the next train. The line is blocked through our
accident, and his train has pulled up within a few yards of our
own. He is now making his way to this very cottage! What
do you say to that?</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> I agree with you, we are lost!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I disagree with you; I should say you are found.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> This man is a reckless fire-eater; he is jealous of me.
He will assuredly shoot us both if he sees us here together. I
am no coward&mdash;but&mdash;I confess I am uneasy.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Cheviot</span></i>). Oh, sir, you have a ready wit; help us
out of this difficulty, and we will both bless you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> With our latest breath!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> That decides me. Madam, remain here with me. Belvawney,
withdraw. (<i><span class="smcap">Belvawney</span> retires.</i>) I will deal with
this maniac alone. All I ask is, that if I find it necessary to
make a statement that is not consistent with strict truth, you,
madam, will unhesitatingly endorse it?</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> I will stake my very existence on its veracity, whatever
it may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Good. He is at hand. Belvawney, go.      [<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Belvawney</span>.</i></p>

<p>Now, madam, repose upon my shoulders, place your arms around
me so&mdash;is that comfortable?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Good.</p>

that I am the tree upon which the fruit of his heart is growing;
and one couldn’t wish to be more than <i>that</i>. And he tells me
that his greatest happiness is to see me happy. So it will be

is to be married to-day! Well, well, it’s for her good. I
must try and bear it&mdash;I must try and bear it.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> And as my dear old papa comes into &pound;1000 a year by
it, I hope he won’t allow it to distress him too much. He must
try and bear up. He mustn’t fret.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> My child, I will not deny that &pound;1000 a year is a
consolation. It’s quite a fortune. I hardly know what I shall
do with it.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I think, dear papa, you will spend a good deal of it on
brandy, and a good deal more on billiards, and a good deal more
on betting.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> It may be so: I don’t say it won’t. We shall see,
Minnie, we shall see. These simple pleasures would certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
tend to soothe your poor old father’s declining years. And my
darling has not done badly either, has she?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> No, dear papa; only fancy! Cheviot has &pound;2000 a year
from shares in the Royal Indestructible Bank.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> And don’t spend &pound;200. By-the-bye, I’m sorry that my
little bird has not contrived to induce him to settle anything on
her; that, I think, was remiss in my tom-tit.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Dear papa, Cheviot is the very soul of honour; he’s a
fine, noble, manly, spirited fellow, but if he <i>has</i> a fault, it is
that he is very, oh very, <i>very</i> stingy. He would rather lose his
heart’s blood than part with a shilling unnecessarily. He’s a
noble fellow, but he’s like that.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Still I can’t help feeling that if my robin had worked
him judiciously&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Papa, dear, Cheviot is an all but perfect character, the
very type of knightly chivalry; but he <i>has</i> faults, and among
other things he’s one of the worst tempered men I ever met in
all my little life. Poor, simple, little Minnie, thought the
matter over very carefully in her silly childish way, and she
came to the conclusion, in her foolish little noddle, that, on the
whole, perhaps she could work it better after marriage, than
before.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Well, well, perhaps my wren is right. (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Don’t laugh at my silly little thoughts, dear papa, when
I say I’m sure she is.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Minnie, my dear daughter, take a father’s advice, the
last he will ever be entitled to give you. If you would be truly
happy in the married state, be sure you have your own way in
everything. Brook no contradictions. Never yield to outside
pressure. Give in to no argument. Admit no appeal. However
wrong you may be, maintain a firm, resolute, and determined
front. These were your angel mother’s principles through
life, and she was a happy woman indeed. I neglected those
principles, and while she lived I was a miserable wretch.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Papa dear, I have thought over the matter very carefully
in my little baby-noddle, and I have come to the conclusion&mdash;don’t
laugh at me, dear papa&mdash;that it is my duty&mdash;my
<i>duty</i>&mdash;to fall in with Cheviot’s views in everything <i>before</i>
marriage, and Cheviot’s duty to fall into my views in everything
<i>after</i> marriage. I think that is only fair, don’t you?</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Yes, I dare say it will come to that.</p>

may not be unfathomed. It is buried in the fathomless gulf of
the Eternal Past. There let it lie.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh, tell me all about it, dear.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> It is a lurid tale. Three months since I fled from
a hated one, who was to have married me. He pursued me.
I confided my distress to a young and wealthy stranger. Acting
on his advice, I declared myself to be his wife; he declared
himself to be my husband. We were parted immediately afterwards,
and we have never met since. But this took place in
Scotland; and by the law of that remarkable country we are

am rent with conflicting doubts! Perhaps he was already
married; in that case, I am a bigamist. Maybe he is dead;
in that case, I am a widow. Maybe he is alive; in that case,
I am a wife. What am I? Am I single? Am I married?
Am I a widow? Can I marry? Have I married? May I

<p><i>Min.</i> Poor dear thing!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> But enough of my selfish sorrows. (<i>Goes up to table
and takes a tart. <span class="smcap">Minnie</span> is annoyed at this.</i>) Tell me about the
noble boy who is about to make you his. Has he any dross?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I don’t know. (<i>Secretly removes tarts to another table
close to door.</i>) I never thought of asking&mdash;I’m such a goose
But papa knows.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Have those base and servile things called settlements
been satisfactorily adjusted? (<i>Eating.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I don’t know. It never occurred to me to inquire.
But papa can tell you.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> The same artless little soul!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> (<i>standing so as to conceal tarts from <span class="smcap">Belinda</span></i>). Yes, I
am quite artless&mdash;quite, quite artless. But now that you <i>are</i>
here you will stay and see me married.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> I would willingly be a witness to my darling’s joy,
but this attire is, perhaps, scarcely in harmony with a scene of
revelry.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Well, dear, you’re not a cheerful object, and that’s the
truth.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> And yet these charnel-house rags may serve to
remind the thoughtless banquetters that they are but mortal.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I don’t think it will be necessary to do that, dear.
Papa’s sherry will make <i>that</i> quite clear to them.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Then I will hie me home, and array me in garments
of less sombre hue.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I think it would be better, dear. Those are the very
things for a funeral, but this is a wedding.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> I see very little difference between them. But it
shall be as you wish, though I have worn nothing but black
since my miserable marriage. There is breakfast, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Yes, at dear Cheviot’s house.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> That is well. I shall return in time for it. Thank
heaven I can still eat! (<i>Takes a tart from table, and exit,
followed by <span class="smcap">Minnie</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Cheviot Hill</span>. He is dressed as for a wedding.</i></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Here I am at last&mdash;quite flurried and hot after the usual
row with the cabman, just when I wanted to be particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
calm and self-contained. I got the best of it though. Dear
me, this is a great day for me&mdash;a great day. Where’s Minnie,
I wonder? Arraying herself for the sacrifice, no doubt. Pouf!
This is a very nervous occasion. I wonder if I’m taking a
prudent step. Marriage is a very risky thing; it’s like Chancery,
once in it you can’t get out of it, and the costs are enormous.
There you are&mdash;fixed. Fifty years hence, if we’re both alive,
there we shall both be&mdash;fixed. That’s the devil of it. It’s an
unreasonably long time to be responsible for another person’s
expenses. I don’t see the use of making it for as long as that.
It seems greedy to take up half a century of another person’s
attention. Besides&mdash;one never knows&mdash;one might come across
somebody else one liked better&mdash;that uncommonly nice girl I
met in Scotland, for instance. No, no, I shall be true to my
Minnie&mdash;quite true. I am quite determined that nothing shall
shake my constancy to Minnie.</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Parker</span>.</i></p>

<p>What a devilish pretty girl!</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> (<i>aside</i>). He’s a mean young man, but he ought to be
good for half-a-crown to-day.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Come here, my dear; a&mdash;How do I look?</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Very nice indeed, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> What, really?</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Really.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> What, tempting, eh?</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Very tempting indeed.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Hah! The married state is an enviable state, Parker.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> <i>Is</i> it, sir? I hope it may be. It depends.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> What do you mean by “it depends?” You’re a member
of the Church of England, I trust? Then don’t you know that
in saying “it depends” you are flying in the face of the
marriage service? Don’t go and throw cold water on the
married state, Parker. I know what you’re going to say&mdash;it’s
expensive. So it is, at first, very expensive, but with economy
you soon retrench that. By a beautiful provision of Nature,
what’s enough for one is enough for two. This phenomenon
points directly to the married state as our natural state.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Oh, for that matter, sir, a tigress would get on with
you. You’re so liberal, so gentle, so&mdash;there’s only one word for
it&mdash;dove-like.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> What, you’ve remarked that, eh? Ha! ha! But dove-like
as I am, Parker, in some respects, yet (<i>getting his arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
round her</i>) in other respects&mdash;(<i>aside</i>), deuced pretty girl!&mdash;in
other respects I am a man, Parker, of a strangely impetuous
and headstrong nature. I don’t beat about the bush; I come
quickly to the point. Shall I tell you a secret? There’s something
about you, I don’t know what it is, that&mdash;in other words,
you are the tree upon which&mdash;no, no, damn it, Cheviot&mdash;not
to-day, not to-day.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> What a way you have with you, sir!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> What, you’ve noticed that, have you? Ha! ha! yes, I
have a way, no doubt; it’s been remarked before. Whenever I
see a pretty girl (and you are a very pretty girl) I can’t help
putting my arm like that (<i>putting it round her waist.</i>) Now,
pleasant as this sort of thing is, and you find it pleasant, don’t
you? (<i><span class="smcap">Parker</span> nods.</i>) Yes, you find it pleasant&mdash;pleasant as
it is, it is decidedly wrong.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> It is decidedly wrong in a married man.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> It is decidedly wrong in a married man. In a married
man it’s abominable, and I shall be a married man in half an
hour. So, Parker, it will become necessary to conquer this
tendency, to struggle with it, and subdue it&mdash;in half an hour
(<i>getting more affectionate</i>). Not that there’s any real harm in
putting your arm round a girl’s waist. Highly respectable
people do it, when they waltz.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Yes, sir, but then a band’s playing.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> True, and when a band’s playing it don’t matter, but
when a band is <i>not</i> playing, why it’s dangerous, you see. You
begin with this, and you go on from one thing to another,
getting more and more affectionate, until you reach <i>this</i> stage
(<i>kissing her</i>). Not that there’s any real harm in kissing, either;
for you see fathers and mothers, who ought to set a good
example, kissing their children every day.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> Lor, sir, kissing’s nothing; everybody does that.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> That is your experience, is it? It tallies with my own.
Take it that I am your father, you are my daughter&mdash;or take it
even that I am merely your husband, and you my wife, and
it would be expected of me. (<i>Kissing her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> But I’m not your wife, sir.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> No, not yet, that’s very true, and, of course, makes a
difference. That’s why I say I must subdue this tendency;
I must struggle with it; I must conquer it&mdash;in half-an-hour.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> (<i>without</i>). Parker, where’s Mr. Cheviot?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> There is your mistress, my dear&mdash;she’s coming. Will
you excuse me? (<i>Releasing her.</i>) Thank you. Good day,
Parker.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> My darling Minnie&mdash;my own, own To Come! (<i>Kissing
her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh, you mustn’t crush me, Cheviot, you’ll spoil my
dress. How do you like it?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> It’s lovely. It’s a beautiful material.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Yes; dear papa’s been going it.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, but you’re indebted to me for that beautiful dress.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> To you! Oh, thank you&mdash;thank you!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Yes. I said to your papa, “Now do for once let the girl
have a nice dress; be liberal; buy the very best that money
will procure, you’ll never miss it.” So, thanks to me, he bought
you a beauty. Seventeen and six a yard if it’s a penny. Dear
me! To think that in half-an-hour this magnificent dress will
be <i>my</i> property!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Yes. Dear papa said that as you had offered to give
the breakfast at your house, he would give me the best dress
that money could procure.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Yes, I <i>did</i> offer to provide the breakfast in a reckless
moment; that’s so like me. It was a rash offer, but I’ve made
it, and I’ve stuck to it. Oh, then, there’s the cake.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh, tell me all about the cake.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> It’s a very pretty cake. Very little cake is eaten at a
wedding breakfast, so I’ve ordered what’s known in the trade
as the three-quarter article.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I see; three-quarters cake, and the rest wood.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> No; three-quarters wood, the rest cake. Be sure, my
dear, you don’t cut into the wood, for it has to be returned to
the pastrycook to be filled up with cake for another occasion.
<i>I</i> thought at first of ordering a seven-eighths article; but one
isn’t married every day&mdash;it’s only once a year&mdash;I mean it’s only
now and then. So I said, “Hang the expense; let’s do the
thing well.” And so it’s a three-quarters.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> How good you are to me! We shall be very happy,
shall we not?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I&mdash;I hope so&mdash;yes. I <i>hope</i> so. Playfully happy, like
two little kittens.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> That will be delightful.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Economically happy, like two sensible people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh, we must be very economical.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> No vulgar display; no pandering to a jaded appetite.
A refined and economical elegance; that is what we must aim
at. A simple mutton chop, nicely broiled, for you; and <i>two</i>
simple mutton chops, <i>very</i> nicely broiled, for me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> And some flowery potatoes&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> A loaf of nice household bread&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> A stick of celery&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> And a bit of cheese, and you’ve a dinner fit for a
monarch.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Then how shall we spend our evenings?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> We’ll have pleasant little fireside games. Are you fond
of fireside games?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh, they’re great fun.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Then we’ll play at tailoring.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Tailoring? I don’t think I know that game.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> It’s a very good game. You shall be the clever little
jobbing tailor, and I’ll be the particular customer who brings
his own materials to be made up. You shall take my measure,
cut out the cloth (real cloth, you know), stitch it together, and
try it on; and then I’ll find fault like a real customer, and you
shall alter it until it fits, and when it fits beautifully that
counts one to you.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Delightful!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Then there’s another little fireside game which is great
fun. We each take a bit of paper and a pencil and try who
can jot down the nicest dinner for ninepence, and the next day
we have it.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh, Cheviot, what a paradise you hold open to me!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Yes. How’s papa?</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> He’s very well and very happy. He’s going to increase
his establishment on the strength of the &pound;1000 a year, and keep
a manservant.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I know. I’ve been looking after some servants for him;
they’ll be here in the course of the morning. A cook, a housemaid,
and a footman. I found them through an advertisement.
They’re country people, and will come very cheap.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Belvawney! This is unexpected. (<i>Much confused.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Yes, Cheviot. At last we meet. Don’t, oh don’t, frown
upon a heartbroken wretch.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Belvawney, I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but I
will not disguise from you that, not having seen you for three
months, I was in hopes that I had got rid of you for ever.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Oh, Cheviot, don’t say that, I am so unhappy. And
you have it in your power to make me comfortable. Do this,
and I will bless you with my latest breath!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> It is a tempting offer; I am not proof against it. We
all have our price, and that is mine. Proceed.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Miss Treherne&mdash;Belinda&mdash;whom I love so dearly, won’t
have anything to say to me.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> It does her credit. She’s a very superior girl.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> It’s all through you, Cheviot. She declares that the
mutual declaration you made to protect her from McGillicuddy
amounts to a Scotch marriage.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> What!!!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> She declares she is your wife. She professes to love me
as fondly as ever; but a stern sense of duty to you forbids her
to hold any communication with me.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, but this is absurd, you know!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Of course it is; but what’s to be done? You left with
Symperson immediately after making the declaration. As soon
as she found you were gone she implored me to tell her your
name and address. Of course I refused, and she quitted me,
telling me that she would devote her life to finding you out.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> But this is simple madness. I can’t have it! This day,
too, of all others! If she’d claimed me last week, or even
yesterday, I wouldn’t have minded, for she’s a devilish fine
woman; but if she were to turn up now&mdash;! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Belvawney,
my dear friend, tell me what to do&mdash;I’ll do anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> It seems that there’s some doubt whether this cottage,
which is just on the border, is in England or Scotland. If it is
in England, she has no case; if it is in Scotland, I’m afraid she
has. I’ve written to the owner of the property to ascertain, and
if, in the mean time, she claims you, you must absolutely decline
to recognize this marriage for a moment.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Not for one moment!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> It was a mere artifice to enable her to escape from
McGillicuddy.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Nothing more!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> It’s monstrous&mdash;perfectly monstrous&mdash;that that should
constitute a marriage. It’s disgraceful&mdash;it’s abominable. Damme,
Cheviot, it’s immoral.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> So it is&mdash;it’s immoral. That settles it in <i>my</i> mind. It’s
immoral.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You’re quite sure you’ll be resolute, Cheviot?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Resolute? I should think so! Why, hang it all, man,
I’m going to be married in twenty minutes to Minnie Symperson!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> What!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>confused at having let this out</i>). Didn’t I tell you? I
believe you’re right; I did <i>not</i> tell you. It escaped me. Oh,
yes, this is my wedding-day.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Cheviot, you’re joking&mdash;you don’t mean this! Why, I
shall lose &pound;1000 a year by it, every penny I have in the world!
Oh, it can’t be&mdash;it’s nonsense!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> What do you mean by nonsense? The married state is
an honourable estate, I believe? A man is not looked upon as
utterly lost to all sense of decency because he’s got married, I’m
given to understand! People have been married before this,
and have not been irretrievably tabooed in consequence, unless
I’m grossly misinformed? Then what the dickens do you
mean by saying “nonsense” when I tell you that I’m going to
be married?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Cheviot, be careful how you take this step. Beware
how you involve an innocent and helpless girl in social destruction.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> What do you mean, sir?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You cannot marry; you are a married man.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Come, come, Belvawney, this is trifling.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You are married to Miss Treherne. I was present, and
can depose to the fact.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, you’re not serious.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Never more serious in my <span class="correction" title="In the original book: live">life</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> But, as you very properly said just now, it was a mere
artifice&mdash;we didn’t mean anything. It would be monstrous to
regard that as a marriage. Damme, Belvawney, it would be
immoral!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I may deplore the state of the law, but I cannot stand
tamely by and see it deliberately violated before my eyes.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>wildly</i>). But, Belvawney, my dear friend, reflect; everything
is prepared for my marriage, at a great expense. I love
Minnie deeply, devotedly. She is the actual tree upon which
the fruit of my heart is growing. There’s no mistake about it.
She is my own To Come. I love her madly&mdash;rapturously.
(<i>Going on his knees to <span class="smcap">Belvawney</span>.</i>) I have prepared a wedding
breakfast at a great expense to do her honour. I have ordered
four flys for the wedding party. I have taken two second-class
Cook’s tourists’ tickets for Ilfracombe, Devon, Exeter, Cornwall,
Westward Ho! and Bideford Bay. The whole thing has cost
me some twenty or twenty-five pounds, and all this will be
wasted&mdash;utterly wasted&mdash;if you interfere. Oh, Belvawney, dear
Belvawney, let the recollection of our long and dear friendship
operate to prevent your shipwrecking my future life. (<i>Sobbing
hysterically.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I have a duty to do. I must do it.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> But reflect, dear Belvawney; if I am married to Miss
Treherne, you lose your income as much as if I married Minnie
Symperson.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> No doubt, if you could prove your marriage to Miss
Treherne. But you can’t&mdash;&mdash; (<i>With melodramatic intensity.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Those eyes!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You don’t know where she is&mdash;&mdash; (<i>With fiendish
exultation.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, those eyes!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> The cottage has been pulled down, and the cottagers
have emigrated to Patagonia&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Oh, those eyes!</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Bel.</i> I’m the only witness left. <i>I</i> can prove your marriage,
if I like; but you can’t. Ha! ha! ha! ha! (<i>with Satanic

and, believe me, dear Cheviot, you have my deepest and most
respectful sympathy.</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Belvawney</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> This is appalling; simply appalling! The cup of happiness
dashed from my lips just as I was about to drink a life-long

I was about to pick the fruit of my heart from the tree upon
which it has been growing so long. I’m a married man! More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
than that, my honeymoon’s past, and I never knew it! Stop
a moment, though. The bride can’t be found; the cottage is
pulled down, and the cottagers have emigrated; what proof is
there that such a marriage ever took place? There’s only
Belvawney, and Belvawney isn’t a proof. Corroborated by the
three cottagers, his word might be worth something; uncorroborated,
it is worthless. I’ll risk it. He can do nothing; the
bride is nowhere; the cottagers are in Patagonia, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>softening</i>). My good girl, what do you wish me to do?
I remember you now perfectly. I <i>did</i> admire you very much&mdash;in
fact, I do still; you’re a very charming girl. Let us talk
this over, calmly and quietly. (<i><span class="smcap">Mag.</span> moves away.</i>) No, you

<p><i>Ch.</i> So I did. The fact is, when I fell in love with you&mdash;don’t
go my pretty bird&mdash;I quite forgot that I was engaged.
There, there! I thought at the time that you were the tree
upon which the fruit of my heart was growing; but I was

(<i><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>, who has been sobbing through this, throws herself

the items&mdash;twenty-two flannel waistcoats are ridiculous, and, in
short, some washerwomen are like this when they’re contradicted&mdash;they
can’t help it&mdash;it’s something in the suds: it undermines
their constitution.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> (<i>sternly</i>). Cheviot, I should like to believe you, but
it seems scarcely credible.</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Oh, sir, he’s na telling ye truly. I’m the puir Lowland

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh, thank you, Mr. Belvawney. How sweetly pretty
that is. Where can I get it?</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> How marvellous is the power of melody over the
soul that is fretted and harassed by anxiety and doubt. I can
understand how valuable must have been the troubadours of old,
in the troublous times of anarchy. Your song has soothed me,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I am indeed glad to think that I have comforted you a
little, dear ladies.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Dear Mr. Belvawney, I don’t know what we should
have done without you. What with your sweet songs, your
amusing riddles, and your clever conjuring tricks, the weary
days of waiting have passed like a delightful dream.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> It is impossible to be dull in the society of one who
can charm the soul with plaintive ballads one moment, and the
next roll a rabbit and a guinea-pig into one.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You make me indeed happy, dear ladies. But my joy
will be of brief duration, for Cheviot may return at any moment
with the news that the fatal cottage was in Scotland, and then&mdash;Oh,
Belinda, what is to become of me?</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> How many issues depend on that momentous question?
Has Belvawney a thousand a year, or is he ruined?
Has your father that convenient addition to his income, or has
he not? May Maggie marry Angus, or will her claim on
Cheviot be satisfied? Are you to be his cherished bride, or are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
you destined to a life of solitary maidenhood? Am I Cheviot’s
honoured wife, or am I but a broken-hearted and desolate
spinster? Who can tell! Who can tell! [<i>Crosses to <span class="smcap">Minnie</span>.</i></p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Bel.</i> (<i>goes to window in second drawing-room</i>). Here is a
cab with luggage&mdash;it is Cheviot! He has returned with the
news! Ladies&mdash;one word before I go. One of you will be
claimed by Cheviot, that is very clear. To that one (whichever
it may be) I do not address myself&mdash;but to the other (whichever
it may be), I say, I love you (whichever you are) with a fervour
which I cannot describe in words. If you (whichever you are)
will consent to cast your lot with mine, I will devote my life
to proving that I love you and you only (whichever it may be)
with a single-hearted and devoted passion, which precludes the
possibility of my ever entertaining the slightest regard for any
other woman in the whole world. I thought I would just
mention it. Good morning!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> None. The McQuibbigaskie has gone abroad! (<i>Both ladies fall weeping.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> More weary waiting! more weary waiting!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Oh, my breaking heart; oh, my poor bruised and
breaking heart!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> We must be patient, dear Belinda. Minnie, my own,
we must be patient. After all, is the situation so very terrible?
Each of you has an even chance of becoming my wife, and in
the mean time I look upon myself as engaged to both of you.
I shall make no distinction. I shall love you both, fondly, and
you shall both love me. My affection shall be divided equally
between you, and we will be as happy as three little birds.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>wiping her eyes</i>). You are very kind and thoughtful,
dear Cheviot.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> I believe, in my simple little way, that you are the
very best man in the whole world!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>deprecatingly</i>). No, no.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Ah, but do let me think so: it makes me so happy to
think so!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Does it? Well, well, be it so. Perhaps I am! And
now tell me, how has the time passed since I left? Have my
darlings been dull?</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> We should have been dull indeed but for the airy
Belvawney. The sprightly creature has done his best to make
the lagging hours fly. He is an entertaining rattlesnake&mdash;I
should say, rattletrap.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>jealous</i>). Oh, <i>is</i> he so? Belvawney has been making
the hours fly, has he? I’ll make <i>him</i> fly, when I catch him!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> His conjuring tricks are wonderful!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Confound his conjuring tricks!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Have you seen him bring a live hen, two hair brushes,
and a pound and a half of fresh butter out of his pocket-handkerchief!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> No, I have not had that advantage!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> It is a thrilling sight.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> So I should be disposed to imagine! Pretty goings on
in my absence! you seem to forget that you two girls are
engaged to be married to <i>me</i>!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Ah, Cheviot! do not judge us harshly. We
love you with a reckless fervour that thrills us to the very
marrow&mdash;don’t we, darling? But the hours crept heavily
without you, and when, to lighten the gloom in which we were
plunged, the kindly creature swallowed a live rabbit and
brought it out, smothered in onions, from his left boot, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
could not choose but smile. The good soul has promised to
teach <i>me</i> the trick.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Has he? That’s his confounded impudence. Now,
once for all, I’ll have nothing of this kind. One of you will be
my wife, and until I know which, I will permit no Belvawneying
of any kind whatever, or anything approaching thereto.
When that is settled, the other may Belvawney until she is
black in the face.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> And how long have we to wait before we shall
know which of us may begin Belvawneying?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I can’t say. It may be some time. The McQuibbigaskie
has gone to Central Africa. No post can reach him, and
he will not return for six years.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Six years! Oh, I cannot wait six years! Why in
six years I shall be eight-and-twenty!</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Six years! Why, in six years the Statute of Limitations
will come in, and he can renounce us both.</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> True; you are quite right. (<i>To Cheviot.</i>) Cheviot,
I have loved you madly, desperately, as other woman never
loved other man. This poor inexperienced child, who clings
to me as the ivy clings to the oak, also loves you as woman
never loved before. Even that poor cottage maiden, whose
rustic heart you so recklessly enslaved, worships you with a
devotion that has no parallel in the annals of the heart. In
return for all this unalloyed affection, all we ask of you is that
you will recommend us to a respectable solicitor.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Ch.</i> But, my dear children, reflect&mdash;I can’t marry all three.
I am most willing to consider myself engaged to all three, and
that’s as much as the law will allow. You see I do all I can.
I’d marry all three of you with pleasure, if I might; but, as
our laws stand at present, I’m sorry to say&mdash;I’m very sorry to

registered under the Joint-Stock Companies Act of Sixty-two,

decay. My dear boy, my very dear boy, I congratulate you.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Don’t be absurd. I’m not going to marry anybody.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Eh? Why, then how&mdash;? I don’t think I quite
follow you.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> There is another contingency on which you come into
the money. My death.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> To be sure! I never thought of that! And, as you
say, a man can die but once.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I beg your pardon. I didn’t say anything of the kind&mdash;you
said it; but it’s true, for all that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> I’m very sorry; but, of course, if you have made up
your mind to it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Why, when a man’s lost everything, what has he to live
for?</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> True, true. Nothing whatever. Still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> His money gone, his credit gone, the three girls he’s
engaged to gone.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> I cannot deny it. It is a hopeless situation. Hopeless,
quite hopeless.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> His happiness wrecked, his hopes blighted; the three
trees upon which the fruit of his heart was growing&mdash;all cut
down. What is left but suicide?</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> True, true! You’re quite right. Farewell. (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Symperson, you seem to think I <i>want</i> to kill myself.
I don’t want to do anything of the kind. I’d much rather live&mdash;upon
my soul I would&mdash;if I could think of any reason for
living. Symperson, can’t you think of <i>something</i> to check the
heroic impulse which is at this moment urging me to a
tremendous act of self-destruction?</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Something! Of course I can! Say that you throw
yourself into the Serpentine&mdash;which is handy. Well, it’s an
easy way of going out of the world, I’m told&mdash;rather pleasant
than otherwise, I believe&mdash;quite an agreeable sensation, I’m
given to understand. But you&mdash;you get wet through; and
your&mdash;your clothes are absolutely ruined!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>mournfully</i>). For that matter, I could take off my
clothes before I went in.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Sym.</i> True, so you could. I never thought of that. You
could take them off before you go in&mdash;there’s no reason why
you shouldn’t, if you do it in the dark&mdash;and <i>that</i> objection
falls to the ground. Cheviot, my lion-hearted boy, it’s impossible
to resist your arguments, they are absolutely convincing.
(<i>Shakes his hand.</i>)</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Good fellow, Symperson&mdash;I like a man who’s open to
conviction! But it’s no use&mdash;all my attractions are gone&mdash;and
I can <i>not</i> live unless I feel I’m fascinating. Still, there’s one
chance left&mdash;Belinda! I haven’t tried her. Perhaps, after all,
she loved me for myself alone! It isn’t likely&mdash;but it’s barely
possible.</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Belvawney</span>, who has overheard these words.</i></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Out of the question; you are too late! I represented to
her that you are never likely to induce any one to marry you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
now that you are penniless. She felt that my income was
secure, and she gave me her hand and her heart.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Then all is lost; my last chance is gone, and the irrevocable
die is cast! Be happy with her, Belvawney; be happy
with her!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Happy! You shall dine with us after our honeymoon
and judge for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> No, I shall not do that; long before you return I shall
be beyond the reach of dinners.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I understand&mdash;you are going abroad. Well, I don’t
think you could do better than try another country.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>tragically</i>). Belvawney, I’m going to try another world!
(<i>Drawing a pistol from his pocket.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> In two minutes I die!</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> You’re joking, of course?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Do I look like a man who jokes? Is my frame of mind
one in which a man indulges in trivialities?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> (<i>in great terror</i>). But my dear Cheviot, reflect&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Why should it concern you? You will be happy with
Belinda. You will not be well off, but Symperson will, and I
dare say he will give you a meal now and then. It will not be
a nice meal, but still it will be a meal.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Cheviot, you mustn’t do this; pray reflect; there are
interests of magnitude depending on your existence.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> My mind is made up. (<i>Cocking the pistol.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> (<i>wildly</i>). But I shall be ruined!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> There is Belinda’s fortune.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> She won’t have me if I’m ruined! Dear Cheviot, don’t
do it&mdash;it’s culpable&mdash;it’s wrong!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Life is valueless to me without Belinda. (<i>Pointing the
pistol to his head.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> (<i>desperately</i>). You shall have Belinda; she is much&mdash;very
much to me, but she is not everything. Your life is very
dear to me; and when I think of our old friendship&mdash;&mdash;!
Cheviot, you shall have anything you like, if you’ll only consent
to live!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> If I thought you were in earnest; but no&mdash;no. (<i>Putting
pistol to head.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> In earnest? of course I’m in earnest! Why what’s the
use of Belinda to me if I’m ruined? Why she wouldn’t look
at me.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> But perhaps if I’m ruined, she wouldn’t look at <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Cheviot, I’ll confess all, if you’ll only live. You&mdash;you
are <i>not</i> ruined!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Not ruined?</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Not ruined. I&mdash;I invented the statement.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>in great delight</i>). You invented the statement? My
dear friend! My very dear friend! I’m very much obliged to
you! Oh, thank you, thank you a thousand times! Oh, Belvawney,
you have made me very, very happy! (<i>Sobbing on his
shoulder, then suddenly springing up.</i>) But what the devil did
you mean by circulating such a report about me? How dare
you do it, sir? Answer me that, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> I did it to gain Belinda’s love. I knew that the unselfish
creature loved you for your wealth alone.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> It was a liberty, sir; it was a liberty. To put it mildly,
it was a liberty.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Bel.</i> It was. You’re quite right&mdash;that’s the word for it&mdash;it
was a liberty. But I’ll go and undeceive her at once.</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Belvawney</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Well, as I’ve recovered my fortune, and with it my tree,
I’m about the happiest fellow in the world. My money, my
mistress, and my mistress’s money, all my own. I believe I
could go mad with joy!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Symperson</span>, in deep black; he walks pensively,
with a white handkerchief to his mouth.</i></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Hallo! You’re still alive?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Alive? Yes; why (<i>noticing his dress</i>), is anything
wrong?</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> No, no, my dear young friend, these clothes are symbolical;
they represent my state of mind. After your terrible
threat, which I cannot doubt you intend to put at once into
execution&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> My dear uncle, this is very touching; this unmans me.
But, cheer up, dear old friend, I have good news for you.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). Good news? What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I am about to remove the weight of sorrow which hangs
so heavily at your heart. Resume your fancy check trousers&mdash;I
have consented to live.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Consented to live? Why, sir, this is confounded
trifling. I don’t understand this line of conduct at all; you
threaten to commit suicide; your friends are dreadfully shocked
at first, but eventually their minds become reconciled to the
prospect of losing you, they become resigned, even cheerful;
and when they have brought themselves to this Christian state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
of mind, you coolly inform them that you have changed your
mind and mean to live. It’s not business, sir&mdash;it’s not business.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> But, my dear uncle, I’ve nothing to commit suicide for;
I’m a rich man, and Belinda will, no doubt, accept me with joy
and gratitude.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Belinda will do nothing of the kind. She has just left
the house with Belvawney, in a cab, and under the most
affectionate circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). Left with Belvawney? Where have they
gone?</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> I don’t know. Very likely to get married.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Married?</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Yes, before the registrar.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I’ve been sold! I see that now! Belvawney has done
me! But I’m not the kind of man who stands such treatment
quietly. Belvawney has found his match. Symperson,
they may get married, but, they shall not be happy;
I’ll be revenged on them both before they’re twenty-four hours
older. She marries him because she thinks his income is
secure. I’ll show her she’s wrong; I won’t blow out my
brains; I’ll do worse.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> I’ll marry.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Marry?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Anybody. I don’t care who it is.</p>

<p><i>Sym.</i> Will Minnie do?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Minnie will do; send her here.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Sym.</i> In one moment, my dear boy&mdash;in one moment!</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Symperson</span>, hurriedly.</i></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Belinda alone in a cab with Belvawney! It’s maddening
to think of it! He’s got his arm round her waist at this
moment, if I know anything of human nature! I can’t stand
it&mdash;I cannot and I will not stand it! I’ll write at once to the
registrar and tell him she’s married (<i>sits at writing table and
prepares to write</i>). Oh, why am I constant by disposition?
Why is it that when I love a girl I can think of no other girl
but that girl, whereas, when a girl loves me she seems to
entertain the same degree of affection for mankind at large?
I’ll never be constant again; henceforth I fascinate but to
deceive!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Minnie</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Mr. Cheviot Hill, papa tells me that you wish to speak
to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>hurriedly&mdash;writing at table</i>). I do. Miss Symperson, I
have no time to beat about the bush; I must come to the point
at once. You rejected me a short time since&mdash;I will not pretend
that I am pleased with you for rejecting me&mdash;on the contrary,
I think it was in the worst taste. However, let bygones
be bygones. Unforeseen circumstances render it necessary that
I should marry at once, and you’ll do. An early answer will
be esteemed, as this is business. (<i>Resumes his writing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Mr. Hill, dear papa assures me that the report about
the loss of your money is incorrect. I hope this may be the
case, but I cannot forget that the information comes from dear
papa. Now dear papa is the best and dearest papa in the whole
world, but he has a lively imagination, and when he wants to
accomplish his purpose, he does not hesitate to invent&mdash;I am
not quite sure of the word, but I think it is “bouncers.”</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>writing</i>). You are quite right, the word is bouncers.
Bouncers or bangers&mdash;either will do.</p>

<p><i>Min.</i> Then forgive my little silly fancies, Mr. Hill; but,
before I listen to your suggestion, I must have the very clearest
proof that your position is, in every way, fully assured.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Mercenary little donkey! I will not condescend to proof.
I renounce her altogether. (<i>Rings bell.</i>)</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Maggie</span> with <span class="smcap">Angus</span> and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Macfarlane</span>. <span class="smcap">Angus</span>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>suddenly seeing her</i>). Maggie, come here. Angus, do
take your arm from round that girl’s waist. Stand back, and
don’t you listen. Maggie, three months ago I told you that
I loved you passionately; to-day I tell you that I love you as
passionately as ever; I may add that I am still a rich man.
Can you oblige me with a postage-stamp? (<i><span class="smcap">Maggie</span> gives him
a stamp from her pocket&mdash;he sticks it on to his letter.</i>) What
do you say? I must trouble you for an immediate answer,
as this is not pleasure&mdash;it’s business.</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Oh, sir, ye’re ower late. Oh, Maister Cheviot, if I’d
only ken’d it before! Oh, sir, I love ye right weel; the bluid
o’ my hairt is nae sae dear to me as thou. (<i>Sobbing on his
shoulder.</i>) Oh, Cheviot, my ain auld love! my ain auld love!</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Puir lassie, it just dra’s the water from my ee
to hear her. Oh, mither, mither! my hairt is just breaking.
(<i>Sobs on Mrs. <span class="smcap">Macfarlane’s</span> shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> But why is it too late? You say that you love me. I
offer to marry you. My station in life is at least equal to your
own. What is to prevent our union?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> (<i>wiping her eyes</i>). Oh, sir, ye’re unco guid to puir little
Maggie, but ye’re too late; for she’s placed the matter in her
solicitor’s hands, and he tells her that an action for breach will
just bring damages to the tune of a thousand pound. There’s
a laddie waiting outside noo, to serve the bonnie writ on ye!
(<i>Turns affectionately to <span class="smcap">Angus</span></i>.)</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>falling sobbing on to sofa</i>). No one will marry me.
There is a curse upon me&mdash;a curse upon me. No one will marry
me&mdash;no, not one!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mac.</i> Dinna say that, sir. There’s mony a woman&mdash;nae
young, soft, foolish lassie, neither; but grown women o’
sober age, who’d be mair a mither than a wife to ye; and that’s
what ye want, puir laddie, for ye’re no equal to takin’ care o’
yersel’.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Mrs. Macfarlane, you are right. I am a man of quick
impulse. I see, I feel, I speak. I&mdash;you are the tree upon
which&mdash;that is to say&mdash;no, no, d&mdash;&mdash;n it, I can’t; I can’t! One
must draw the line somewhere. (<i>Turning from her with disgust.</i>)</p>

heaven, thank heaven!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> I thought that, as I came in, I heard you say something
about a tree.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> You are right. As you entered I was remarking that I

two thousand a year, and I love you passionately. I lay my
hand, my heart, and my income, all together, in one lot, at
your feet!</p>

<p><i>Miss T.</i> Cheviot, I love you with an irresistible fervour, that
seems to parch my very existence. I love you as I never loved
man before, and as I can never hope to love man again. But,
in the belief that you were ruined, I went with my own adored
Belvawney before the registrar, and that registrar has just
made us one! (<i>Turns affectionately to <span class="smcap">Belvawney</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> (<i>embraces <span class="smcap">Belinda</span></i>). Bless him for it&mdash;bless him for it!</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>deadly calm</i>). One word. I have not yet seen the letter
that blights my earthly hopes. For form’s sake, I trust I may
be permitted to cast my eye over that document? As a matter
of business&mdash;that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Certainly. Here it is. You will find the situation of
the cottage described in unmistakable terms. (<i>Hands the letter
to <span class="smcap">Cheviot</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>reads</i>). “In reply to your letter I have to inform you
that Evan Cottage is certainly in England. The deeds relating
to the property place this beyond all question.” Thank you;
I am satisfied. (<i>Takes out pistol.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Now, sir, perhaps you will kindly release that young
lady. She is my wife! (<i><span class="smcap">Cheviot’s</span> arm has crept mechanically

Halloa! (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>All.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> (<i>reads</i>). “P.S.&mdash;I may add that the border line runs

<p><i>Wil.</i> He returned quite sudden last night, and left this here
plant, with a message that he would call at twelve o’clock
to-day, miss.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I shall be very glad to see him. So this is really a
shoot of the dear old tree!</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> Come all the way from Lunnon, too. There’s lots of
’em hereabouts, miss; I could ha’ got you a armful for the
asking.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes, I dare say; but this comes from the dear old house
at Hampstead.</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> Do it, now?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> You remember the old sycamore on the lawn where
Mr. Spreadbrow and I used to sit and learn our lessons years
ago?&mdash;well, this is a piece of it. And as Mr. Spreadbrow was
going to London, I asked him to be so kind as to call, and tell
the new people, with his compliments, that he wanted to cut
a shoot from it for a young lady who had a very pleasant
recollection of many very happy hours spent under it. It was
an awkward thing for a nervous young gentleman to do, and
it’s very kind of him to have done it. (<i>Gives back the plant,
which he places against upper porch of house.</i>) So he’s coming
this morning?</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> Yes, miss, to say good-bye.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>busies herself at stand of flowers</i>). Good-bye! “How
d’ye do?” you mean.</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> No, miss, good-bye. I hear Mr. Spreadbrow’s off to
Ingy.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes; I believe he is going soon.</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> Soon? Ah, soon enough! He joins his ship at
Southampton to-night&mdash;so he left word yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> To-night? No; not for some weeks yet? (<i>Alarmed.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> To-night, miss. I had it from his own lips, and he’s
coming to-day to say good-bye.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>aside</i>). To-night!</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> And a good job too, say I, though he’s a nice young
gentleman too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I don’t see that it’s a good job.</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> I don’t want no young gentleman hanging about here,
miss. I know what they comes arter;&mdash;they comes arter the
flowers.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> The flowers? What nonsense!</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> No, it ain’t nonsense. The world’s a haphazard
garden where common vegetables like me, and hardy annuals
like my boys, and sour crabs like my old ’ooman, and pretty
delicate flowers like you and your sisters grow side by side.
It’s the flowers they come arter.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Really, Wilcox, if papa don’t object I don’t see what
you have to do with it.</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> No, your pa don’t object; but I can’t make your pa
out, miss. Walk off with one of his tuppenny toolips and he’s
your enemy for life. Walk off with one of his darters and he
settles three hundred a year on you. Tell ’ee what, miss; if
I’d a family of grown gals like you, I’d stick a conservatory
label on each of them&mdash;“Please not to touch the specimens!”&mdash;and
I’d take jolly good care they didn’t.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> At all events, if Mr. Spreadbrow is going away to-night,
you need not be alarmed on my account. I am a flower that
is not picked in a minute.</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> Well said, miss! And as he <i>is</i> going, and as you won’t
see him no more, I don’t mind saying that a better-spoken
young gentleman I don’t know. A good, honest, straightfor’ard
young chap he is&mdash;looks you full in the face with
eyes that seem to say, “I’m a open book&mdash;turn me over&mdash;look
me through and through&mdash;read every page of me, and if you
find a line to be ashamed on, tell me of it, and I’ll score it
through.”</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>demurely</i>), I dare say Mr. Spreadbrow is much as
other young men are.</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> As other young men? No, no&mdash;Lord forbid, miss!
Come&mdash;say a good word for him, miss, poor young gentleman.
He’s said many a good word of you, I’ll go bail.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Of me?</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> (<i>takes ladder which is leaning against the house and
places it against upper porch of house, and, going a little way
up it, speaks this speech from it, <span class="smcap">Jenny</span> remains seated.</i>) Ay.
Why, only Toosday, when I was at work again the high
road, he rides up on his little bay ’oss, and he stands
talking to me over the hedge and straining his neck to catch
a sight of you at a window; that was Toosday. “Well,
Wilcox,” says he, “it’s a fine day!”&mdash;it rained hard Toos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>day,
but it’s always a fine day with him. “How’s Miss
Northcott?” says he. “Pretty well, sir,” says I. “Pretty
she always is; and well she ought to be if the best of hearts
and the sweetest of natures will do it!” Well, I knew <i>that</i>,
so off I goes to another subject, and tries to interest him in
drainage, and subsoils, and junction pipes; but no, nothin’
would do for him, but he must bring the talk back to <i>you</i>.
So at last I gets sick of it, and I up and says: “Look
ye here, Mr. Spreadbrow,” says I, “I’m only the gardener.
This is Toosday, and Miss Northcott’s pa’s in the study, and I
dessay <i>he’ll</i> be happy to hear what you’ve got to say about <i>her</i>.”
Lord, it’d ha’ done your heart good to see how he flushed up as
he stuck his spurs into the bay and rode off fifteen miles to the
hour. (<i>Laughing.</i>) That was Toosday.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>very angrily</i>). He had no right to talk about me to a
servant.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Wil.</i> (<i>coming down from ladder</i>). But, bless you, don’t be
hard on him, he couldn’t help it, miss. But don’t you be
alarmed, he’s going away to-night, for many and many a long
year, and you won’t never be troubled with <i>him</i> again. He’s
going with a heavy heart, take my word for it, and I see his
eyes all wet, when he spoke about saying good-bye to you;
he’d the sorrow in his throat, but he’s a brave lad, and he
gulped it down, though it was as big as an apple. (<i>Ring.</i>)
There he is. Soothe him kindly, miss&mdash;don’t you be afraid,
you’re safe enough&mdash;he’s a good lad, and he can’t do no harm
now.</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Wilcox</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> What does he want to go to-day for? he wasn’t going
for three months. He could remain if he liked; India has gone
on very well without him for five thousand years: it could have
waited three months longer; but men are always in such a
hurry. He might have told me before&mdash;he <i>would</i> have done so
if he really, really liked me! I wouldn’t have left <i>him</i>&mdash;yes
I would&mdash;but then that’s different. Well, if some people can
go, some people can remain behind, and some other people will
be only too glad to find <i>some people</i> out of their way!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Spreadbrow</span>, followed by <span class="smcap">Wilcox</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>suddenly changes her manner, rises and crosses</i>). Oh,
Mr. Spreadbrow, how-d’ye-do? Quite well? I’m so glad!
Sisters quite well? That’s right&mdash;how kind of you to think
of my tree! So you are really and truly going to India to-night?
That <i>is</i> sudden!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Yes, very sudden&mdash;terribly sudden. I only heard
of my appointment two days ago, in London, and I’m to join
my ship to-night. It’s very sudden indeed&mdash;and&mdash;and I’ve
come to say good-bye.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Good-bye. (<i>Offering her hand.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Oh, but not like that, Jenny! Are you in a
hurry?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Oh dear no, I thought you were; won’t you sit down?
(<i>They sit.</i>) And so your sisters are quite well?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Not very; they are rather depressed at my going so
soon. It may seem strange to you, but they will miss me.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I’m sure they will. I should be terribly distressed at
your going&mdash;if I were your sister. And you’re going for so
long!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I’m not likely to return for a great many years.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>with a little suppressed emotion</i>). I’m so sorry we shall
not see you again. Papa will be very sorry.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> More sorry than you will be?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Well, no, I shall be very sorry, too&mdash;very, <i>very</i> sorry&mdash;there!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> How very kind of you to say so.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> We have known each other so long&mdash;so many years,
and we’ve always been good friends, and it’s always sad to say
good-bye for the last time (<i>he is delighted</i>) to anybody! (<i>he
relapses</i>). It’s so very sad when one knows for certain that it
<i>must</i> be the last time.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I can’t tell you how happy I am to hear you say
it’s so sad. But (<i>hopefully</i>) my prospects are not altogether
hopeless, there’s one chance for me yet. I’m happy to say
I’m extremely delicate, and there’s no knowing, the climate
may not agree with me, and I may be invalided home! (<i>very
cheerfully</i>).</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Oh! but that would be very dreadful.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Oh, yes, of course it would be dreadful in one sense;
but it&mdash;it would have its advantages. (<i>Looking uneasily at
<span class="smcap">Wilcox</span>, who is hard at work.</i>) Wilcox is hard at work,
I see.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Oh, yes, Wilcox is hard at work. He is very industrious.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Confoundedly industrious! He is working in the
sun without his hat. (<i>Significantly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Poor fellow.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Isn’t it injudicious, at his age?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Oh, I don’t think it will hurt him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I really think it will. (<i>He motions to her to send
him away.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Do you? Wilcox, Mr. Spreadbrow is terribly distressed
because you are working in the sun.</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> That’s mortal good of him. (<i>Aside, winking.</i>) They
want me to go. All right; he can’t do much harm now.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, sir, the sun is hot, and I’ll go and look after the
cucumbers away yonder, right at the other end of the garden.
(<i><span class="smcap">Wilcox</span> going&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spreadbrow</span> is delighted.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> No, no, no!&mdash;don’t go away! Stop here, only put on
your hat. That’s what Mr. Spreadbrow meant. (<i><span class="smcap">Wilcox</span> puts
on his hat.</i>) There, <i>now</i> are you happy?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I suppose it will soon be his dinner-time?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Oh, he <i>has</i> dined. You <i>have</i> dined, haven’t you,
Wilcox?</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> Oh, yes, miss, <i>I’ve</i> dined, thank ye kindly.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes; he has dined! Oh! I quite forgot!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I must interrupt you for a moment, Wilcox; I quite
forgot that I promised to send some flowers to Captain Dampier
this afternoon. Will you cut them for me?</p>

<p><i>Wil.</i> Yes, miss, (<i>knowingly</i>). Out of the conservatory, I
suppose, miss? (<i><span class="smcap">Wilcox</span> going, <span class="smcap">Spreadbrow</span> again delighted.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> No, these will do. (<i>Pointing to open-air flower beds&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spreadbrow</span>
again disappointed.</i>) Stop, on second thoughts
perhaps you <i>had</i> better take them out of the conservatory, and
cut them carefully&mdash;there’s no hurry.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Wil.</i> (<i>aside.</i>) <i>I</i> understand! Well, poor young chap, let
him be, let him be; he’s going to be turned off to-night, and
his last meal may as well be a hearty one.</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Wilcox</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>rises in great delight</i>). How good of you&mdash;how
very kind of you!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> To send Captain Dampier some flowers?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>much disappointed</i>). Do you really want to send
that fellow some flowers?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> To be sure I do. Why should I have asked Wilcox to
cut them?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I thought&mdash;I was a great fool to think so&mdash;but I
thought it might have been because we could talk more
pleasantly alone.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I really wanted some flowers; but, as you say, we
certainly can talk more pleasantly alone. (<i>She busies herself
with preparing the sycamore.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I’ve often thought that nothing is such a check on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>&mdash;pleasant
conversation&mdash;as the presence of&mdash;of&mdash;a gardener&mdash;who
is not interested in the subject of conversation.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>gets the tree, and cuts off the matting with which it is
bound with garden scissors which she has brought with her from
the table</i>). Oh, but Wilcox is very interested in everything that
concerns you. Do let me call him back.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> No, no; not on my account!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> He and I were having quite a discussion about you
when you arrived. (<i>Digging a hole for tree.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> About me?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes; indeed we almost quarrelled about you.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> What, was he abusing me then?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Oh, no; he was speaking of you in the highest terms.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>much taken aback</i>). Then&mdash;<i>you</i> were abusing me!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> N&mdash;no, not exactly <i>that</i>; I&mdash;I didn’t agree with all
he said&mdash;(<i>he is much depressed, she notices this</i>) at least, not
openly.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>hopefully</i>). Then you did secretly?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I shan’t tell you.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Because it will make you dreadfully vain. There!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>delighted</i>). Very&mdash;very dreadfully vain? (<i>he takes
her hand</i>).</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Very dreadfully vain indeed. Don’t! (<i>Withdraws her
hand. During this she is digging the hole, kneeling on the edge of
the flower bed; he advances to her and kneels on edge of bed
near her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Do you know it’s most delightful to hear you say
that? It’s without exception the most astonishingly pleasant
thing I’ve ever heard in the whole course of my life! (<i>Sees the
sycamore.</i>) Is that the tree I brought you? (<i>Rises from his
knees.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes. I’m going to plant it just in front of the drawing-room
window, so that I can see it whenever I look out. Will
you help me? (<i>He prepares to do so; she puts it into the hole.</i>)
Is that quite straight? Hold it up, please, while I fill in the
earth. (<i>He holds it while she fills in the earth; gradually his hand
slips down till it touches hers.</i>) It’s no use, Mr. Spreadbrow,
our both holding it in the same place! (<i>He runs his hand up
the stem quickly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I beg your pardon&mdash;very foolish of me.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Very.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I’m very glad there will be something here to make
you think of me when I’m many many thousand miles away,
Jenny. For I shall be always thinking of <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Really, now that’s very nice! It will be so delightful,
and so odd to know that there’s somebody thinking about me
right on the other side of the world!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>sighing</i>). Yes. It <i>will</i> be on the other side of the
world!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> But that’s the delightful part of it&mdash;right on the other
side of the world! It will be such fun!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Fun!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Of course, the farther you are away the funnier it will
seem. (<i>He is approaching her again.</i>) Now keep on the other
side of the world. It’s just the distance that gives the point to
it. There are dozens and dozens of people thinking of me close
at hand. (<i>She rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>taking her hand</i>). But not as I think of you, Jenny&mdash;dear,
dear Jenny&mdash;not as I’ve thought of you for years and
years, though I never dared tell you so till now. I can’t bear to
think that anybody else is thinking of you kindly, earnestly,
seriously, as I think of you.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). You may be quite sure, Harry, quite, quite
sure that you will be the only one who is thinking of me
kindly, seriously, and earnestly (<i>he is delighted</i>) in India. (<i>He
relapses&mdash;she withdraws her hand.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> And when this tree, that we have planted together,
is a big tree, you must promise me that you will sit under
it every day, and give a thought now and then to the old playfellow
who gave it to you.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> A big tree! Oh, but this little plant will never live to
be a big tree, surely?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Yes, if you leave it alone, it grows very rapidly.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Oh, but I’m not going to have a big tree right in front
of the drawing-room window! It will spoil the view, it will be
an eyesore. We had better plant it somewhere else.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). No, let it be, you can cut it down when it
becomes an eyesore. It grows very rapidly, but it will, no
doubt, have lost all interest in your eyes long before it becomes
an eyesore.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> But Captain Dampier says that a big tree in front of
a window checks the current of fresh air.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Oh, if Captain Dampier says so, remove it.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Now don’t be ridiculous about Captain Dampier; I’ve
a very great respect for his opinion on such matters.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I’m sure you have. You see a great deal of Captain
Dampier, don’t you?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes, and we shall see a great deal more of him; he’s
going to take the Grange next door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). That will be very convenient.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>demurely</i>). Very.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>jealously</i>). You seem to admire Captain Dampier
very much.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I think he is very good-looking. Don’t you?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> He’s well enough&mdash;for a small man.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Perhaps he’ll grow.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Is Captain Dampier going to live here always?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes, until he marries.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). Is&mdash;is he likely to marry?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I don’t know. (<i>Demurely.</i>) Perhaps he may.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> But whom&mdash;whom?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>bashfully</i>). Haven’t you heard? I thought you knew!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). No, no, I don’t know; I’ve heard nothing.
Jenny&mdash;dear Jenny&mdash;tell me the truth, don’t keep anything
from me, don’t leave me to find it out; it will be terrible to hear
of it out there; and, if you have ever liked me&mdash;and I’m sure you
have&mdash;tell me the whole truth at once!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>bashfully</i>). Perhaps, as an old friend, I ought to have
told you before; but indeed, indeed I thought you knew.
Captain Dampier is engaged to be married to&mdash;to&mdash;my cousin
Emmie.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>intensely relieved</i>). To your cousin Emmie. Oh,
thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh, my dear, dear Jenny,
do&mdash;do let me take your hand. (<i>Takes her hand and shakes it
enthusiastically.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Are you going?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> No. (<i>Releasing it&mdash;much cast down.</i>) I was going
to ask you to do me a great favour, and I thought I could ask
it better if I had hold of your hand. I was going to ask you if
you would give me a flower&mdash;any flower, I don’t care what it is.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>affecting surprise</i>). A flower? Why, of course I will.
But why?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). That I may have a token of you and of
our parting wherever I go; that I may possess an emblem of
you that I shall never&mdash;never part with, that I can carry about
with me night and day wherever I go, throughout my whole life.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>apparently much affected, crosses slowly, stoops and takes
up large geranium in pot</i>). Will this be too big?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>disconcerted</i>). But I mean a flower&mdash;only a flower.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Oh, but do have a bunch! Wilcox shall pick you a
beauty.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> No, no; I want you to pick it for me. I don’t care
what it is&mdash;a daisy will do&mdash;if <i>you</i> pick it for me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> What an odd notion! (<i>Crossing to flower-stand, and
picking a piece of mignonette&mdash;he puts down flower-pot by bed.</i>)
There! (<i>picking a flower and giving it to him</i>) will that do?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I can’t tell you how inestimably I shall prize this
flower. I will keep it while I live, and whatever good fortune
may be in store for me, nothing can ever be so precious in my
eyes.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I had no idea you were so fond of flowers. Oh, do have
some more!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> No, no&mdash;but&mdash;you must let me give you this in
return; I brought it for you, Jenny dear&mdash;dear Jenny! Will
you take it from me? (<i>Takes a rose from his button-hole, and
offers it.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>amused and surprised</i>). Oh yes! (<i>Takes it and puts it
down on the table carelessly&mdash;he notices this with much emotion.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Well, I’ve got to say good-bye; there’s no reason
why it shouldn’t be said at once. (<i>Holding out his hand.</i>)
Good-bye, Jenny!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Good-bye! (<i>He stands for a moment with
her hand in his&mdash;she crosses to porch.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Haven’t&mdash;haven’t you anything to say to me?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>after thinking it over</i>). No, I don’t think there’s
anything else. No&mdash;nothing. (<i>She leans against the porch&mdash;he
stands over her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Jenny, I’m going away to-day, for years and years,
or I wouldn’t say what I’m going to say&mdash;at least not yet.
I’m little more than a boy, Jenny; but if I were eighty, I
couldn’t be more in earnest&mdash;indeed I couldn’t! Parting for so
many years is like death to me; and if I don’t say what I’m
going to say before I go, I shall never have the pluck to say it
after. We were boy and girl together, and&mdash;and I loved you
then&mdash;and every year I’ve loved you more and more; and now
that I’m a man, and you are nearly a woman, I&mdash;I&mdash;Jenny dear&mdash;I’ve
nothing more to say!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> How you astonish me!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Astonish you? Why, you know that I loved you.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes, yes; as a boy loves a girl&mdash;but now that I am a
woman it’s impossible that you can care for me.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Impossible&mdash;because you are a woman!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> You see it’s so unexpected.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Unexpected?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes. As children it didn’t matter, but it seems so
shocking for grown people to talk about such things. And then,
not gradually, but all at once&mdash;in a few minutes. It’s awful!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Oh, Jenny, think. I’ve no time to delay&mdash;my
having to go has made me desperate. One kind word from you
will make me go away happy: without that word, I shall go
in unspeakable sorrow. Jenny, Jenny, say one kind word!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). Tell me what to say?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> It must come from you, my darling; say whatever
is on your lips&mdash;whether for good or ill&mdash;I can bear it now.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Well, then: I wish you a very very pleasant voyage&mdash;and
I hope you will be happy and prosperous&mdash;and you must take
great care of yourself&mdash;and you can’t think how glad I shall
be to know that you think of me, now and then, in India.
There!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Is that all?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Yes, I think that’s all. (<i>Reflectively.</i>) Yes&mdash;that’s all.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Spread.</i> Then&mdash;(<i>with great emotion which he struggles to
suppress</i>) there’s nothing left but to say good-bye&mdash;(<i>Music in
orchestra till end of Act, “Good-bye, Sweetheart”</i>)&mdash;and I hope
you will always be happy, and that, when you marry, you will
marry a good fellow who will&mdash;who will&mdash;who will&mdash;&mdash; Good-bye!</p>

<h3><a name="SH_ACT_II" id="SH_ACT_II"></a>ACT II.</h3>

<p class="scene-open"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>The same as in Act I., with such additions and changes
as may be supposed to have taken place in thirty years.
The house, which was bare in Act I., is now entirely covered
with Virginia and other creepers; the garden is much more
fully planted than in Act I., and trees that were small in
Act I. are tall and bushy now; the general arrangement of
the garden is the same, except that the sycamore planted in
Act I. has developed into a large tree, the boughs of which
roof in the stage; the landscape has also undergone a metamorphosis,
inasmuch as that which was open country in
Act I. is now covered with picturesque semi-detached villas,
and there are indications of a large town in the distance.
The month is September, and the leaves of the Virginia
creepers wear their autumn tint.</i></p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i><span class="smcap">Jenny</span> discovered seated on a bench at the foot of the tree, and
<span class="smcap">Ruth</span> is standing by her side, holding a skein of cotton,
which <span class="smcap">Jenny</span> is winding. <span class="smcap">Jenny</span> is now a pleasant-looking
middle-aged lady.</i></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Have you any fault to find with poor Tom?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> No, miss, I’ve no fault to find with Tom. But a girl
can’t marry every young man she don’t find fault with, can she
now, miss?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Certainly not, Ruth. But Tom seems to think you
have given him some cause to believe that you are fond of him.</p>

<p><i>Ruth</i> (<i>bridling up</i>). It’s like his impudence, miss, to say so!
Fond of <i>him</i> indeed!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> He hasn’t said so, Ruth, but I’m quite sure he thinks
so. I have noticed of late that you have taken a foolish pleasure
in playing fast and loose with poor Tom, and this has
made him very unhappy&mdash;very unhappy indeed; so much so
that I think it is very likely that he will make up his mind to
leave my service altogether.</p>

<p><i>Ruth</i> (<i>piqued</i>). Oh, miss, if Tom can make up his mind to
go, I’m sure <i>I</i> wouldn’t stand in his way for worlds.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> But I think you would be sorry if he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Oh yes, miss, I should be sorry to part with Tom!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Then I think it’s only right to tell you that the foolish
fellow talks about enlisting for a soldier, and if he does it at
all, he will do it to-night.</p>

<p><i>Ruth</i> (<i>with some emotion</i>). Oh, miss, for that, I do like Tom
very much indeed; but if he wants to ’list, of course he’s his
own master, and if he’s really fond of me, what does he want to
go and ’list for? (<i>Going to cry.</i>) One would think he would
like to be where he could talk to me, and look at me&mdash;odd
times! I’m sure I don’t want Tom to go and ’list!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Then take the advice of an old lady, who knows something
of these matters, and tell him so before it’s too late&mdash;you
foolish, foolish girl! Ah, Ruth, I’ve no right to be hard on
you! I’ve been a young and foolish girl like yourself in my
time, and I’ve done many thoughtless things that I’ve learnt
to be very sorry for. I’m not reproaching you&mdash;but I’m speaking
to you out of the fulness of my experience, and take my
word for it, if you treat poor Tom lightly, you may live to be
very sorry for it too! (<i>Taking her hand.</i>) There, I’m not angry
with you, my dear, but if I’d taken the advice I’m giving you,
I shouldn’t be a lonely old lady at a time of life when a good
husband has his greatest value. (<i>Ring.</i>) Go and see who’s at
the gate!</p>

<p class="stage-dir">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Jenny</span>. <span class="smcap">Ruth</span> goes to the gate, wiping her eyes on her apron&mdash;she opens it.</i></p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Spreadbrow</span> (now <span class="smcap">Sir Henry</span>).</i></p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> My dear, is this Mr. Braybrook’s?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Is he at home?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> No, sir, he is not; but mistress is.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Will you give your mistress my card? (<i>Feeling for
his card-case.</i>) Dear me, I’ve left my cards at home! Never
mind&mdash;will you tell your mistress that a gentleman will be
greatly indebted to her, if she will kindly spare him a few
minutes of her time? Do you think you can charge yourself
with that message?</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Ruth.</i> Mistress is in the garden, sir; I’ll run and tell her, if
you’ll take a seat.</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Ruth</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> That’s a good girl! (<i>He sits on seat.</i>) I couldn’t
make up my mind to pass the old house without framing an
excuse to take a peep at it. (<i>Looks round.</i>) Very nice&mdash;very
pretty&mdash;but, dear me, on a very much smaller scale than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
fancied. Remarkable changes in thirty years! (<i>Rises and
walks round trees, looking about.</i>) Why, the place is a town,
and a railway runs right through it. And this is really the
old garden in which I spent so many pleasant hours? Poor
little Jenny!&mdash;I wonder what’s become of her? Pretty little
girl, but with a tendency to stoutness; if she’s alive, I’ll be
bound she’s fat. So this is Mr. Braybrook’s, is it? I wonder
who Braybrook is&mdash;I don’t remember any family of that name
hereabouts. (<i>Looking off.</i>) This, I suppose, is Mrs. Braybrook.
Now, how in the world am I to account for my visit?</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Jenny</span>&mdash;she curtsies formally, he bows.</i></p>

<p>I beg your pardon, I hardly know how to explain this intrusion.
Perhaps I had better state my facts, they will plead my
apology:&mdash;I am an old Indian civilian, who, having returned
to England after many years’ absence, is whiling away a day in
his native place, and amusing himself with polishing old
memories&mdash;bright enough once, but sadly tarnished&mdash;sadly
tarnished!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Indeed? May I hope that you have succeeded?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Indifferently well&mdash;indifferently well. The fact is,
I hardly know where I am, for all my old landmarks are swept
away; I assure you I am within the mark, when I say that
this house is positively the only place I can identify.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> The town has increased very rapidly of late.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Rapidly! When I left, there were not twenty houses
in the place, but (<i>politely</i>) that was long before your time. I
left a village, I find a town&mdash;I left a beadle, I find a mayor and
corporation&mdash;I left a pump, I find a statue to a borough
member. The inn is a “Palace Hotel Company&mdash;” the alms-house
a county jail&mdash;the pound is a police station, and the
common a colony of semi-detached bungalows! Everything
changed, including myself&mdash;everything new, except myself&mdash;ha,
ha!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I shall be glad to offer you any assistance in my power,
I should be a good guide, for I have lived here thirty-two
years!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Thirty-two years! is it possible? Then surely I
ought to know you? (<i>He feels for his glasses.</i>) My name is
Spreadbrow&mdash;Sir Henry Spreadbrow!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Spreadbrow! (<i>Putting on spectacles.</i>) Is it possible?
Why, my very dear old friend (<i>offering both her hands</i>), don’t
you recollect me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>he puts on his double eye-glass, takes both her hands</i>).
God bless me!&mdash;is it possible?&mdash;and this is really you!&mdash;you
don’t say so! Dear me, dear me! Well, well, well! I assure
you I am delighted, most unaffectedly delighted, to renew our
friendship! (<i>Shaking hands again, they sit under tree and look
at each other curiously.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Not changed a bit! My dear Jane, you really must
allow me. (<i>They shake hands again.</i>) And now tell me, how
is Mr. Braybrook?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>rather surprised</i>). Oh, Mr. Braybrook is very well; I
expect him home presently; he will be very glad to see you,
for he has often heard me speak of you.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Has he indeed? It will give me the greatest&mdash;the
very greatest possible pleasure, believe me (<i>very emphatically</i>),
to make his acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>still surprised at his emphatic manner</i>). I’m sure he
will be delighted.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Now tell me all about yourself. Any family?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Any family?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Mr. Braybrook?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Well&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Mr. Braybrook is a bachelor.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> A bachelor? Then let me understand&mdash;am I not
speaking to Mrs. Braybrook?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> No, indeed you are not! Ha, ha! (<i>much amused</i>). Mr.
Braybrook is my nephew; the place belongs to him now.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Oh! then, my dear Jane, may I ask who you are?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I am not married.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Not married!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> No; I keep house for my nephew.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Why, you don’t mean to sit there and look me in
the face and tell me, after thirty years, that you are still Jane
Northbrook?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>rather hurt at the mistake</i>). Northcott.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Northcott, of course. I beg your pardon&mdash;I should
have said Northcott. And you are not Mrs. Braybrook? You
are not even married! Why, what were they about&mdash;what were
they about? Not married! Well, now, do you know, I am very
sorry to hear that. I am really more sorry and disappointed
than I can tell you. (<i>She looks surprised and rather hurt.</i>)
You’d have made an admirable wife, Jane, and an admirable
mother. I can’t tell you how sorry I am to find that you are
still Jane Northbrook&mdash;I should say, Northcott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> The same in name&mdash;much changed in everything else.
(<i>Sighing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Changed? Not a bit&mdash;I won’t hear of it. I knew
you the moment I saw you! We are neither of us changed.
Mellowed perhaps&mdash;a little mellowed, but what of that? Who
shall say that the blossom is pleasanter to look upon than the
fruit? Not I for one, Jane&mdash;not I for one.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Time has dealt very kindly with us, but we’re old folks
now, Henry Spreadbrow. (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I won’t allow it, Jane&mdash;I won’t hear it. (<i>Rises.</i>)
What constitutes youth? A head of hair? Not at all; I was
as bald as an egg at five and twenty&mdash;babies are always bald.
Eyesight? Some people are born blind. Years? Years are
an arbitrary impertinence. Am I an old man or you an old
woman, because the earth contrives to hurry round the sun in
three hundred and sixty-five days? Why, Saturn can’t do it in
thirty years. If I had been born on Saturn I should be two
years old, ma’am&mdash;a public nuisance in petticoats. Let us be
thankful that I was not born on Saturn. No&mdash;no, as long as I
can ride to cover twice a week, walk my five and twenty miles
without turning a hair, go to bed at twelve, get up at six, turn
into a cold tub and like it, I’m a boy, Jane&mdash;a boy&mdash;a boy!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> And you are still unmarried?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I? Oh dear, yes&mdash;very much so. No time to
think of marriage. Plenty of opportunity, mind, but no leisure
to avail myself of it. I’ve had a bustling time of it, I assure
you, Jane, working hard at the Bar and on the Bench, with
some success&mdash;with some success; (<i>sits again</i>) and now that
I’ve done my work, I throw myself back in my easy-chair, fold
my hands, cross my legs, and prepare to enjoy myself. Life is
before me, and I’m going to begin it. Ha, ha! And so we
are really Jane Northcott still?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Still Jane Northcott.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I’m indignant to hear it&mdash;I assure you that I am
positively indignant to hear it. You would have made some
fellow so infernally happy; (<i>rises</i>) I’m sorry for that fellow’s
sake&mdash;I don’t know him, but still I am sorry. Ah, I wish I had
remained in England. I do wish, for the very first time since
I left it, that I had remained in England.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Indeed! And why?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Why? Because I should have done my best to
remove that reproach from society. I should indeed, Jane!
Ha, ha! After all, it don’t much matter, for you wouldn’t have
had me. Oh yes! you had no idea of it; but, do you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
I’ve a great mind to tell you&mdash;I <i>will</i> tell you. Do you know,
I was in love with you at one time. Boy and girl, you know&mdash;boy
and girl. Ha, ha! <i>you’d</i> no idea of it, but I was!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>in wonder</i>). Oh yes; I knew it very well.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>much astonished</i>). You knew it? You knew that
I was attached to you!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Why, of course I did!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Did you, indeed! Bless me, you don’t say so!
Now that’s amazingly curious. Leave a woman alone to find
<i>that</i> out! It’s instinctive, positively instinctive. Now, my
dear Jane, I’m a very close student of human nature, and in
pursuit of that study I should like above all things to know by
what signs you detected my secret admiration for you. (<i>Takes
her hand.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Why, bless the man! There was no mystery in the
matter! You told me all about it!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I told you all about it?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Certainly you did&mdash;here, in this garden.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> That I admired you&mdash;loved you?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Most assuredly! Surely you’ve not forgotten it. (<i>He
drops her hand.</i>) <i>I</i> haven’t.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I remember that I had the impertinence to be very
fond of you. I forgot that I had the impertinence to tell you
so. I remember it now. I made a fool of myself. I remember
it by that. I told you that I adored you, didn’t I?&mdash;that you
were as essential to me as the air I breathed&mdash;that it was impossible
to support existence without you&mdash;that your name
should be the most hallowed of earthly words, and so forth.
Ha, ha! my dear Jane, before I’d been a week on board I was
saying the same thing to a middle-aged governess whose name
has entirely escaped me. (<i>She has exhibited signs of pleasure
during the earlier part of this speech, and disappointment at the
last two lines.</i>) What fools we make of ourselves!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> And of others!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Oh, I meant it, Jane; I meant every word I said to
you.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> And the governess?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> And the governess! I would have married you,
Jane.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> And the governess?</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> And the governess! I’d have married <i>her</i>, if she had
accepted me&mdash;but she didn’t. Perhaps it was as well&mdash;she was
a widow with five children&mdash;I cursed my destiny at the time,
but I’ve forgiven it since. I talked of blowing out my brains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
I’m glad I didn’t do it, as I’ve found them useful in my profession.
Ha! ha! (<i>Looking round; <span class="smcap">Jenny</span> stands watching
him.</i>) The place has changed a good deal since my time&mdash;improved&mdash;improved&mdash;we’ve
all three improved. I don’t quite
like this tree, though&mdash;it’s in the way. What is it? A kind
of beech, isn’t it?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> No, it’s a sycamore.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Ha! I don’t understand English trees&mdash;but it’s a
curious place for a big tree like this, just outside the drawing-room
window. Isn’t it in the way?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> It <i>is</i> rather in the way.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I don’t like a tree before a window, it checks the
current of fresh air&mdash;don’t you find that?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> It <i>does</i> check the current of fresh air.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Then the leaves blow into the house in autumn, and
that’s a nuisance&mdash;and besides, it impedes the view.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> It is certainly open to these objections.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Then cut it down, my dear Jane. Why don’t you
cut it down?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Cut it down! I wouldn’t cut it down for worlds. That
tree is identified in my mind with many happy recollections.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Remarkable the influence exercised by associations
over a woman’s mind. Observe&mdash;you take a house, mainly because
it commands a beautiful view. You apportion the rooms
principally with reference to that view. You lay out your
garden at great expense to harmonize with that view, and,
having brought that view into the very best of all possible
conditions for the full enjoyment of it, you allow a gigantic
and wholly irrelevant tree to block it all out for the sake of the
sentimental ghost of some dead and gone sentimental reality!
Take my advice and have it down. If I had had anything
to do with it, you would never have planted it. I shouldn’t
have allowed it!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> You had so much to do with it that it was planted
there at your suggestion.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> At mine? Never saw it before in my life.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> We planted it together thirty years ago&mdash;the day you
sailed for India.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> It appears to me that that was a very eventful day
in my career. We planted it together! I have no recollection
of having ever planted a gigantic sycamore anywhere. And
we did it together! Why, it would take a dozen men to
move it.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> It was a sapling then&mdash;you cut it for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> (<i>suddenly and with energy</i>). From the old sycamore
in the old garden at Hampstead! Why, I remember; I went
to London expressly to get it for you. (<i>Laughing&mdash;sitting on
her left.</i>) And the next day I called to say good-bye, and I
found you planting it, and I helped; and as I was helping I
found an opportunity to seize your hand. (<i>Does so.</i>) I grasped
it&mdash;pressed it to my lips&mdash;(<i>does so</i>), and said, “My dear, dear
Jenny” (<i>he drops her hand suddenly</i>), and so forth. Never
mind <i>what</i> I said&mdash;but I meant it&mdash;I meant it! (<i>Laughs
heartily&mdash;she joins him, but her laughter is evidently forced&mdash;eventually
she shows signs of tears, which he doesn’t notice.</i>)
It all comes back with a distinctness which is absolutely
photographic. I begged you to give me a flower&mdash;you gave me
one&mdash;a sprig of geranium.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> Mignonette.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> <i>Was</i> it mignonette? I think you’re right&mdash;it was
mignonette. I seized it&mdash;pressed it to my trembling lips&mdash;placed
it next my fluttering heart, and swore that come what
might I would never, never part with it!&mdash;I wonder what I
did with that flower!&mdash;And then I took one from my button
hole&mdash;begged you to take it&mdash;you took it, and&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;you
threw it down carelessly on the table, and thought no
more about it, you heartless creature&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Oh, I was
very angry! I remember it perfectly; it was a camellia.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>half crying aside</i>). Not a camellia, I think.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Yes, a camellia, a large white camellia.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I don’t think it was a camellia; I rather think it was
a rose.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Nonsense, Jane&mdash;come, come, you hardly looked
at it, miserable little flirt that you were; and you pretend,
after thirty years, to stake your recollection of the circumstance
against mine? No, no, Jane, take my word for it, it
was a camellia.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> I’m sure it was a rose!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> No, I’m sure it was a camellia.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> (<i>in tears</i>). Indeed&mdash;indeed, it was a rose. (<i>Produces a
withered rose from a pocket-book&mdash;he is very much impressed&mdash;looks
at it and at her, and seems much affected.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Why, Jane, my dear Jane, you don’t mean to say
that this is the very flower?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> That is the very flower! (<i>Rising.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Strange! You seemed to attach no value to it
when I gave it to you, you threw it away as something utterly
insignificant; and when I leave, you pick it up, and keep it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
for thirty years! (<i>Rising.</i>) My dear Jane, how like a
woman!</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> And you seized the flower I gave you&mdash;pressed it to
your lips, and swore that wherever your good or ill fortune
might carry you, you would never part with it; and&mdash;and you
quite forgot what became of it! My dear Harry, how like
a man!</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> I was deceived, my dear Jane&mdash;deceived! I had
no idea that you attached so much value to my flower.</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> We were both deceived, Henry Spreadbrow.</p>

<p><i>Spread.</i> Then is it possible that in treating me as you did,
Jane, you were acting a part?</p>

<p><i>Jen.</i> We were both acting parts&mdash;but the play is over, and

<p><i>Spread.</i> No, no, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Janet">Jane</span>, the play is <i>not</i> over&mdash;we will talk of
nothing else&mdash;the play is not nearly over. (<i>Music in orchestra,

from my hardened old heart, so far from the play being over,

<h2 title="">DAN’L DRUCE, BLACKSMITH.</h2>

<h3><a name="DD_ACT_I" id="DD_ACT_I"></a>ACT I.</h3>

<p class="scene-open"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Interior of <span class="smcap">Dan’l Druce’s</span> hut, a tumble-down old
shanty, of the rudest description; with very small wood
fire. The whole place is as squalid and miserable as
possible. Wind and snow without. Rain and wind heard
each time door is opened. Night.</i></p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> (<i>without</i>). Hullo! Dan’l, art within? (<i>Knocks.</i>) Dan’l,
I say, open, will you? (<i>He kicks the door open.</i>) Why, the
hut’s empty. Where’s the old devil gone, I wonder? Come
in, master, out of the storm.</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Marple</span>.</i></p>

<p>Don’t be afeard (<i><span class="smcap">Marple</span> shuts door</i>); he’ll be a bit rusty, to
be sure, at our coming in without leave, but that’ll blow off
sooner than the gale outside.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Is the man away?</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Nay, he’s never a hundred yards from this; he’s
hauling up his boat on the beach, maybe, or taking in his nets,
and making all snug and taut for the night; and well he may,
for the devil’s let loose, and there’ll be mischief afore morning.
The devil likes these here Norfolk coasts, burn him!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And so Jonas lives here.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Jonas? No, Dan’l&mdash;Dan’l Druce.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Well, Dan’l Druce, if that’s what he calls himself.
It’s a strange hole for such a man as he!</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> It’s a fit hole for such a dog as he! A surly, scowling,
drunken, miserly, half-starved cur! Never was a sulky hound
so far athwart the world’s ways as Dan’l Druce. Why, he’s as
rich as a Jew, and never gave bit nor sup to a soul in the town.
Oh, take my word for it, it’s a fit hole for such as he. There’s
only one fitter, and I wish he was in it!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Stop that cursed red rag of yours, will you?</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Come, come, civil words, master, civil words!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Set the example. I am this man’s brother.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Well, you’ve got the family tongue in your
head, anyhow. If you’re his brother, maybe you know how he
came to live here all alone?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Maybe I do.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> They say that before he came here&mdash;a matter o’ three
or four years since&mdash;he was a decent sort o’ body enough, a
blacksmith, I <i>do</i> hear, but he got struck half silly like through
some bad luck, and he’s been a changed man ever since.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Oh, they say that, do they?</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Ay. Well, I don’t know what he <i>was</i>, but I know
what he <i>is</i>; that’s enough for me. The scowlingest, black-browedest,
three-corneredest chap <i>I</i> ever see, ’cept as regards
children, and he’s as fond o’ children as a young girl, and the
littler they are the more he likes ’em, and they likes him.
Now, I’m as tender-hearted as a kitten, but I <i>hates</i> children,
and they can’t abide me. That’s odd, ain’t it?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ay.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Yes, that’s Dan’l Druce’s story as far as we knows it
down in these parts. Maybe you know more?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Maybe I do.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Now, I dare swear there was a woman at the bottom
of it all. I never got <i>my</i> chain cable kinked but a woman
had a hand in it.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> (<i>coming forward</i>). Hark ye, my lad, you’re hard on
women. From the look of you, I’ve a notion no woman ever
had much to do with any trouble of yours, saving your mother
when she bore you. No, no, your tongue’s done all the mischief
that ever come to <i>you</i>. You let women alone; I’m sure they
never interfere with <i>you</i>.</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dan’l Druce</span>. He has a bundle of nets over his shoulder,
and he is half tipsy. His appearance is that of a man of
fifty, but haggard with want. His hair is long and matted,
and he has a beard of some days’ growth on his chin.</i></p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Hullo! Who’s that? Joe Ripley, eh? Why, Joe
Ripley, what dost thou do skulking in other men’s huts when
they’re away? Nothing to lay hands on <i>here</i>, Joe Ripley.
And thou’st brought a friend, eh? Didst thee think there was
too much plunder for a man to carry that thou’st brought an
ass to help thee? There’s nowt for thee here. Take thine
ugly face into the storm; maybe thou’lt get it battered straight.
Come, out wi’ ’ee!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Hold thy peace, man. I want nowt of thine. I’ve
brought thee money for thy two nets.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Where is it?</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> And here’s a man as says he’s thy brother&mdash;and I wish
him joy o’ his brotherhood! I found him in the village asking
for thee, so I brought him to thee. (<i><span class="smcap">Marple</span> holds out his
hand.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>not heeding him</i>). Gi’ me the money.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Dost thou not know me, Jonas Marple?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Dead. Dead three years ago.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ay, thou gavest thyself out as dead, that <i>he</i> might
make an honest woman of her.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Thou liest, she <i>was</i> an honest woman, for all she left
me. ’Twas him that stole her, God bless her! Jonas Marple
died the day she left him. I’m Dan’l Druce.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> I knew there was a woman in it.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And if Jonas <i>be</i> dead, hast thou no word of welcome
to Jonas’s brother?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> None! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Ripley</span>.</i>) Gi’ me the money.</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> There! Ay, count it; we’re all thieves and liars. (<i>To
<span class="smcap">Marple</span>.</i>) That’s his craze. Is it right?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> I dunno, I can’t count to-night. Let it be, I’ll count
it to-morrow. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Marple</span>.</i>) How didst thou find me?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I found thee through this fellow. I was in the town
on law business, and I heard men talk of such a one as thou,
and I asked and asked, and found out that thou wast the
brother who used to work wi’ me. I’ve come to ask thee to
come back to us, and be the man thou wast wont to be. Come,
man, be thine old self, thou canst not be better; throw off thy
present self, thou canst not be worse!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Not worse? Why, man, I’m a king, alone here!
Here I live, free from liars and thieves, alone! alone! What,
back to the world, the hollow, lying world? Not I! Back
to the rock on which my ship was wrecked? Not I! Back
to the den of thieves that stripped me? Not I! No, no; I
don’t find fish come back to my nets when once they’ve slipped
through the meshes, and I’m no more a fool than my fish.
See here&mdash;I’ve lived here nigh upon four years, and ’cepting
some such gaping fool as him (<i>indicating <span class="smcap">Ripley</span></i>), I’ve seen
no soul, and no soul’s seen me. I’ve done harm to none, and
none’s done harm to me. I’ve told no lies, and no lies ain’t
been told me. I’ve robbed no one, and no one’s robbed me.
Can any one who walks the world say as much? I’ve lived
on the fish I’ve caught, the garden I’ve dug, and I’ve saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
money by the nets I’ve made, not much&mdash;a trifle to such as
thou, and I’ve sent it far from here&mdash;I never keep it here, no,
no. I’ve no hopes, no cares, no fears. And thou askest me to
go back to the foul old world, the world that poor dead and
gone Jonas Marple was robbed in; the bitter black world
that blighted his poor harmless life. No! I’m going to bide
here.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Well, as thou wilt, Jonas.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Dan’l&mdash;that’s my name, Dan’l Druce. Jonas Marple
died the day his wife left him. His wife’s a widow, and, mayhap,
married again. God bless her!</p>

<p><i>Rip.</i> Thou’lt do no good wi’ him, there’s a devil’s flare in his
eyes; best let him bide.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Ay, best let him bide. I’m a poor thing of skin and
bone; and this here arm, which made light of a forty-pound
hammer four years since, is but a soft-roed thing now; but
when muscle went out, devil come in; steer clear o’ me, and
let me bide.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Thou’rt sadly changed: it’s fearsome to see a good,
honest, hearty soul changed into the white-faced ghost of what
he was. Time was when every beggar had the pulling of thy
poor purse-strings, and none were turned empty away from the
door. To think that Jonas Marple should have earned the
name of miser!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Does it seem so strange to thee? Hast thou e’er
known what it is to set thy heart night and day on one object,
to dream of it, sleepin’ and wakin’, to find the hope of it
flavouring thy meat and drink, and weavin’ itself so into thy
life that every thought o’ thy brain is born of it, and every
deed o’ thy hand has some bearin’ on it? And havin’ done
all this, and so fashioned, and twisted, and turned, and trimmed
the chances at thy hand that the one hope of thy soul shall
be helped on by it, hast thou known what it is to find, at one
bitter, black blow, thy hope made hopeless, thy love loveless,
thy life lifeless? So did I hope and pray to be blessed with a
little child&mdash;so was my hope withered when I thought it sure
of fulfilment. I had a store of love in my battered heart to <i>set
on some one thing of my creating</i>; it was there for that end,
and for none other. When <i>she</i> left me (curse him!) I knew,
for certain, that one thing would never be of flesh and blood,
and it never will, for the love of my heart is given over to the
next best thing&mdash;gold and silver, gold and silver. Ay, brother,
I love my gold as other men love their bairns; it’s of my
making, and I love it, I love it! A mean and sordid love, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>be,
but hard, and bad, and base as thou thinkest me, I’ve
prayed a thousand times that my gold might take a living
form, that the one harmless old hope of my wrecked life might
come true.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> The age of miracles is past, Jonas. Well, I’ve said my
say and done my do. Stay where thou art, and Heaven forgive
thee, Jonas Marple.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>sternly</i>). He’s dead!</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> (<i>warmly</i>). He is; dead to the call of reason, dead to
the voice of human love, dead to everything that marks a
reasoning man off from the beasts that perish. Thou hast well
said, Jonas Marple <i>is</i> dead&mdash;rest his soul!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Amen! Now go.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">[<i><span class="smcap">Marple</span>, after a pause, shrugs his shoulders, and exit with <span class="smcap">Ripley</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Ay, he’s dead, dead, dead! He died then, that the
blackest devil that ever cursed this earth might put her right
with the world. Heaven send he has done so! And the bairn!
It was promised to me,&mdash;promised, but the promise was a
lie, a damned black lie&mdash;not hers, no, no! not hers, but
the double-dyed devil who stole her from me. (<i>Opens a hole
in the floor in front of stool, and takes out a bag of money.</i>)
This is my bairn now (<i>handling the money</i>); see, here’s
another day to thy life, another inch to thy height; grow
as thou growest, child, and thou’lt be a golden beauty ere
long. Gold, the best thing in the world; “as good as gold,”&mdash;why,
it’s a saying; the best thing on earth to make a bairn
of! Here’s a child that’ll never grow up to bring sorrow on its
dad’s head, that costs nowt to keep, and never grows so big but
you wish it bigger&mdash;my bairn! I’ve worked for thee and
starved for thee that I might see thee grow, and thou hast
growed, growed right royally! Lie here, my beauty, lie there in
peace; I’ll never wake thee but to add to thy life, my bairn,
my beautiful golden bairn!</p>

<p class="stage-dir">[<i>The door is suddenly burst open, and <span class="smcap">Sir Jasper Combe</span> enters
hurriedly, followed by <span class="smcap">Reuben</span> as if pursued. They are both very ragged and dirty, dressed
in torn and faded Royalist uniforms; <span class="smcap">Sir Jasper</span>, an officer, <span class="smcap">Reuben</span>,
a sergeant. <span class="smcap">Reuben</span> carries a child of three or four years of age, wrapped in a cloak, so as not
to be seen by <span class="smcap">Dan’l</span>. They close the door hurriedly, and listen for their pursuers.

<p><i>Jas.</i> At last! safe at last from the yelping bloodhounds!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
By the Lord Harry, but of many bouts with death this is the
bout that had like to have gone hardest with us, Reuben!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Who and what are ye, jail-birds?</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Hark, sir! I think I hear them again! (<i>Listening
eagerly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>very loudly</i>). Who and what are ye? (<i>Going up to
them.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>listening</i>). Hold thy fool’s tongue, or I’ll slit it!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> (<i>placing his hand over <span class="smcap">Dan’l’s</span> mouth</i>). Nay, it is
necessary that some one hold thy tongue, and if thou wilt not
do it, I must!</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Listen to me, my friend! (<i><span class="smcap">Reuben</span> removes his hand
from <span class="smcap">Dan’l’s</span> mouth. He again attempts to speak, <span class="smcap">Reuben</span>
again gags him.</i>) Nay, cover him up. He will hear the better
for that he cannot give tongue the while. Now, keep thine
ears open, for this concerns thee: We are proscribed Royalists,
and you, miserable man, have harboured us, Heaven help you
and, if we are taken here, I, and he, and thou will surely
hang&mdash;I and he for our sins against the Parliament, thou&mdash;for
thy virtue in aiding, abetting, and comforting us. Dost thou
clearly understand me?</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> (<i>with his hand still over <span class="smcap">Dan’l’s</span> mouth</i>). Dost thou
clearly understand the Colonel? (<i><span class="smcap">Dan’l</span> cannot answer.
<span class="smcap">Reuben</span> repeats his question loudly and angrily.</i>) Dost thou
clearly understand the Colonel?</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Reuben</span></i>). When thou desirest him to be silent it is
well to gag him; when thou wouldst have him speak it
is judicious to remove the gag!</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> As you will, sir. Now then (<i>removing his hand</i>), dost
thou clearly understand?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>loudly</i>). I clearly understand that ye are two
marauding devils, who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> (<i>hastily clapping his hand over <span class="smcap">Dan’l’s</span> mouth</i>). He
does not understand.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>listening</i>). They’ve wheeled about, and their hoofs are
dying away in the distance. Reuben, let the old beggar go;
he may give tongue now till he split his lungs, if he will. We
are safe, at least for the present, Reuben; and see to thy pistol&mdash;we
may have to stand a siege yet, and this door must be
barricaded; but with what?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>taking up an iron bar from the fireplace and holding
it in a threatening attitude</i>). Go your ways, both of ye; or as
I am a man I’ll brain ye with this bar!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> The very thing! (<i>Wrenches it easily out of his hand
and barricades the door with it, while <span class="smcap">Reuben</span> shows <span class="smcap">Dan’l</span>
a pistol.</i>) There! why, it’s made for it! A thousand thanks,
old gentleman. (<i><span class="smcap">Dan’l</span> recovers himself’ flies at <span class="smcap">Jasper</span>, who
pushes him away; he falls on to a stool.</i>) Now, master, listen
to me, and if you have any respect for yourself, keep your ears
open, for I’m speaking words of life and death. We are
desperate men in a desperate strait, and little disposed to stand
on ceremony, as you may perhaps have remarked. We are
flying for our lives, and we desire to cross to France, where my
lady is, and where we shall be safe. To carry out this design
we have worked our way to the coast, sleeping under hedges
and ricks for six bleak days, and tramping in the wind’s eye
for six stormy nights, till the fire of life seems to have died out
of our bodies, and our legs to have withered from their trunks.
You have a stout boat on the beach; when this accursed gale
shall have blown itself out you shall have the distinction of
working us across to the opposite coast. In the mean time
we appoint you our host, and we shall be prepared to look
favourably on whatever meat or drink you can set before us.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Do I look like a man who keeps open house?</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> No, hang me if you do.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> If I had my way, I’d hang you, anyhow.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Ay, and there’s many more of your way of thinking.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> I’ll be sworn there are. Well, get out o’ my hut
(<i>rises</i>); this is not <i>your</i> way; this is not the road to the gallows.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> My good fellow, that’s why we took it!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Who, in the devil’s name, are ye?</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> I’m a cavalier colonel, a trifle out of repair, and a
thought begrimed, maybe, but that’ll wash off. Royalist to the
backbone, as I proved some time since at Worcester, where my
backbone had to bear the brunt of the flight! This is my regiment,
the King’s Dragoons (<i>indicating <span class="smcap">Reuben</span></i>). Come,
doff thy hat, King’s Dragoons, and salute the gentleman; the
credit of the corps is in thy keeping, Reuben, for thou’rt all
that’s left of it! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Dan’l</span>.</i>) A worthy fellow, this regiment of
mine, but somewhat shy and constrained in good company, but
he will improve when he sees that flask of Schiedam that thou
art about to surprise us with. Now, tell me, art thou for the
Parliament?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Then thou art for the king?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> It’s a lie! I’m for myself.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> And for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Nay, I’ll be damned if I am!</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Nay, I’ll swear thou’rt for us if thou be not traitor
to thyself; for if we hang at all we all hang together. <i>I’ll</i> see
to that. Now, what food have you got?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> None (<i>sulkily</i>).</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> What can you get?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Nothing.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Where are we then?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Nowhere.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Harkee, sir, I’m just in that mood that I don’t care the
flash of a flint whose life is swept out of my way when it comes
betwixt me and my wants. I want food&mdash;get it.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> I’ve no food&mdash;I’m a beggar.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Here’s a coin&mdash;our last&mdash;go and get bread, meat, and
drink. Now be off, or Reuben here shall whip you with his
sword-flat till he drops. (<i><span class="smcap">Reuben</span> draws.</i>) And, mark me, if
by deed, word, or sign you do aught to give a clue to our hiding-place,
I’ll burn the hut to the ground, and everything in it.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> But&mdash;&mdash; (<i><span class="smcap">Reuben</span> pushes him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Not a word. Be off, and do your errand&mdash;and mind, no
treachery, or&mdash;&mdash; (<i><span class="smcap">Jasper</span> takes a burning log from the fire,
and holds it immediately over the hole where <span class="smcap">Dan’l’s</span> money is

<p><i>Jas.</i> Whew! I’ve brought the old devil to his senses. What
a life this is! Was ever poor dog so hounded about from pillar
to post as Jasper Combe? and for no better reason than that he
is a gentleman, and loves his king!</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Pardon, sir, but I never was accounted a gentleman,
and for my king I care not one jot, yet am I hounded much
as you are.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Thou art hounded much as I am because thou thyself
art as I am, though in a lower degree. King Charles is my
king (<i>raises hat</i>)&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;and I serve him, and am
hunted for so doing. Jasper Combe is <i>thy</i> king (<i><span class="smcap">Reuben</span> raises
hat</i>)&mdash;God bless him likewise!&mdash;and thou servest him, and thou
art hunted for so doing. The analogy is complete. Be thou as
faithful to thy king as I am to mine, and thy king will reward
thee&mdash;when my king rewards me! Is the child safe?</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> (<i>uncovering the child, and bringing it down</i>). Ay, sir,
thanks to my cloak; though I’m but a sorry dry-nurse, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
taken to it late in life; but it’s never too late to learn, and I’ve
learnt this, that babes won’t eat ship’s biscuits, and strong
waters choke them. Their poor little heads can’t stand strong
waters. I’ll marry some day on that piece of knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Add this to it, to my dower&mdash;that when thou art flying
for thy life it’s best to leave thy babes behind. A dozen times
we might have got away but for being hampered with this
squalling abomination. Was ever officer of cavalry accursed
with such a ridiculous element of peril?</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Was ever sergeant of horse armed with such a mischief-dealing
implement?</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Well, there’s no help for it. My lady would have gone
mad had I returned to her without it. She is devotedly attached
to the child.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Strange that attachment of some mothers for their
children. My mother always disliked me and kept me at a
convenient distance; but <i>she</i> was a Scotchwoman and not
liable to be imposed on.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Well, we must make the best of a bad job. Whew!
How cold it is. I’m chilled to the marrow of my bones. That
fellow is taking his leisure over his errand; see, Reuben, if
thou canst find aught in the hut.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Here’s a locker, your honour, but close fastened.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> A proof that there’s something in it. Start it with thy
sword. Stay, I’ll do it (<i>takes up hatchet</i>); so, gently (<i>opens
locker</i>). Good, a crust of bread and some dried fish.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> And a bottle of right good Schiedam, that never paid
duty, I’ll be sworn.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>taking it</i>). And on that account fairly forfeit to the
Crown, which, on this occasion, I represent. So, bring an
armful of those logs and make a merry blaze, for I ache as
though I were trussed in a suit of thumbscrews. (<i><span class="smcap">Reuben</span>
brings wood.</i>) That’s well; ha! ha! Now let us enjoy
ourselves. Who would have thought the dingy old pig-stye
had so much life in it! It’s the first good blaze I’ve
seen since the long-nosed devils fired the old mill we lived in.
Come, we’ll be jolly. (<i><span class="smcap">Reuben</span> takes a piece of bread, <span class="smcap">Jasper</span>
snatches it from him.</i>) Nay, of food there’s but enough for one
(<i><span class="smcap">Jasper</span> eats; <span class="smcap">Reuben</span> takes up bottle and holds it to the light,
<span class="smcap">Jasper</span> snatches it from him</i>), and of Schiedam there’s not
nearly enough for one. Why, thou gross and sensuous varlet,
canst thou not be jolly without meat and drink? ’Tis always
so with the baseborn; of intellectual recreation they have no
notion whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> I’ve eaten nothing for two days, and I’m hungry.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Thou’lt have to wait till the old scoundrel returns.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> (<i>at door</i>). There’s no signs of him yet.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Then give reins to thy voice and hail him. He took
the road to the left. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Reuben</span> shouting&mdash;his voice dies
away in the distance.</i>) Here’s a plight for the Lord of Combe-Raven!
Stripped of an ancestral mansion and two thousand
old acres; hunted to his death by broad-brimmed bloodhounds&mdash;separated
from his pretty wife by some two hundred miles of
barren land and stormy water, and saddled with a confounded
brat that hampers his flight, let him turn whithersoever he
will! And say that I cross this accursed Channel&mdash;how am I
to get to Paris&mdash;penniless as I am? When I think of what
I have before me, I’m minded to make short work with this
world, and try another! By the Lord Harry!&mdash;(<i>stamps impatiently;
his foot starts a board over <span class="smcap">Dan’l’s</span> hoard.</i>) Ha!
Why, what’s this? Not gold? (<i>Takes out some.</i>) Gold&mdash;and
in profusion! Here’s a way out of our difficulties, if Combe-Raven
were but the man to take it. The old miser! (<i>Handling
the money.</i>) Bah&mdash;in another week’s time we may, perhaps,
come down to this sort of thing&mdash;who knows? But not yet&mdash;no,
not yet. (<i>Throws it into hole.</i>) Lie there&mdash;I’ll not meddle
with thee, though (<i>closing hole</i>) thou’lt be spent on a worse
errand than helping <span class="smcap">Jasper</span> Combe to his wife and his king, I’ll
be sworn.</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Reuben</span> in breathless haste. <span class="smcap">Jasper</span> quickly

<p><i>Reu.</i> Yes, sir&mdash;we must fly&mdash;and that at once.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> What d’ye mean?</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> I mean treachery&mdash;the old man has played us false!&mdash;I
hear the horses’ hoofs in the distance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> A thousand devils wring his damnable neck! Run to
the boat&mdash;get her ready for the sea. I’ll join thee at once and
we’ll launch her together.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> If there’s such a thing as a crust of bread, or the tail
of a dried mackerel&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> But there’s not&mdash;be off. (<i>He watches him out, then
quickly turns to the hole in which the money is concealed.</i>) So&mdash;this
changes the aspect of affairs. Old fool, thou hast
betrayed us, and this is fair plunder. (<i>Takes it out of the hole.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
With fair luck we may beat across to France to-night, and
once there we are safe. But the child&mdash;again a clog on our
movements! She would surely perish in an open boat on such
a night as this. It’s a matter of life and death&mdash;<i>her</i> life as
well as mine. It would be murder to take her to sea with us,
and it would be murder to remain and fight these fellows with
her in our arms. There is no help for it&mdash;I must leave her
here&mdash;this locket will serve to identify her (<i>putting a locket
and chain on her neck</i>)&mdash;and I’ll reclaim her when I get across.
They’ll never harm a child!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Reuben</span> hurriedly.</i></p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> I’m coming. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Reuben</span>. <span class="smcap">Jasper</span> writes on a piece

<p class="scene-open"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>The interior of a picturesque old forge. The forge is
open at the back, and <span class="smcap">Druce’s</span> cottage is seen through
opening. There is a path off. <span class="smcap">Dan’l Druce</span>, a hearty-looking
old man of sixty-four, is discovered hammering
lustily at a piece of red-hot iron on his anvil.</i></p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>laying down his hammer</i>). Whew! That job’s done!
Eh, but I’m that breathed, surelie. Why, Dan’l Druce, if
thou’rt worked out like this at twelve o’ noon, it’s time ye
thought of getting a partner into the old forge. But somehow
the forge fire seems to strike hotter than o’ yore; and the iron
of to-day takes more hammerin’ than the iron o’ thirty year
ago. Mebbe I’m growin’ old. Well, a body can’t hope to live
sixty-four year, and leave off a young un arter all. ’Twouldn’t
be fair on the boys&mdash;no, nor the gals neither&mdash;eh, Dorothy?</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> running.</i></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, father, thou shouldst see the Green, by Raby’s
End. The village is brave with banners and garlands. I have
helped to deck it, father. And Master Maynard, the constable,
is mounted on an ale cask to receive Sir Jasper Combe, who
should pass on his way to Combe-Raven in half an hour; and
the band of music hath arrived from Norwich, and <i>they’re</i> all
on ale casks too; and they are to play stirring music while the
constable readeth an address to his worship!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> It is a merciful provision, Dorothy, lest the address
be heard. So Sir Jasper will be here in half an hour, eh?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Yes, and I long to see him. I have heard that he is a
grave gentleman of goodly presence, and beyond measure kindly.
He is a righteous landlord, too, so folk say, and giveth largely
to the poor.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> He is needed in these parts, for the poor were sorely
used by the late squire. I shall be right glad to welcome him,
but (<i>wearily</i>) I’ll not go to Raby’s End to do it. (<i>Sits on
stool.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Art thou wearied, father?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Growin’ old, lass, growin’ old. It’s one o’ those bless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>ings
that allers comes to him that waits long enough. But I
don’t grumble, Dorothy. If old age will leave me strength
enough to pull at a pipe and empty a tankard&mdash;two things
thou canst not do for me, Dorothy&mdash;why, that’s all I ask. My
lass can do the rest.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> As I have been to thee so will I be to the end.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> There’s no saying, Dorothy. Thou’rt comely, lass, and
mebbe, ere long, some smart young lad will whip thee from my
arms, and carry thee away to t’other side o’ the sunrise. There’s
mor’n one within a mile o’ this who’d give his right arm to do
it now.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay, thou art unkind. Did I not tend thee when thou
wast hale and strong, and shall I desert thee now that thou
hast most need of me?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>with emotion</i>). My lass, Heaven knows I never needed
thee more than when thou wast left at my hut fourteen year
since. But I’ve news to gladden thee&mdash;thine old playmate,
Geoffrey Wynyard, is returned from sea, and is now on his road
from Norwich to see thee.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Geoffrey returned? Oh, I am right glad! Oh, indeed,
father, I am right glad! Truly thou has brought me fair news.
And is he well&mdash;and hath he prospered?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Ay, and growed out o’ knowledge. He was but a long-legged
lad when he left, but he’s a man now, and a goodly one,
I warrant thee. See to him when he cometh, for he’ll bide
here wi’ us. (<i>After a pause.</i>) My darlin’&mdash;thou’lt never leave
me?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Never, while I live!</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Dan.</i> God bless thee, my child!</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Kisses her and exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Geoffrey returned! and Geoffrey a stalwart mariner,
and grown to man’s estate! I can scarce believe it! Of a
truth I could weep for very joy! I was but a child when he
left, and now&mdash;I am seventeen! Geoffrey loved children,&mdash;it
may be that he will be displeased with me now that I am a
woman. I am rejoiced that I am decked in my new gown&mdash;it
is more seemly than the russet, in which, methinks, I did
look pale. Geoffrey a man!&mdash;my old playmate a man!
Pity that I have not my new shoes, for they are comely; but
they do compress my feet, and so pain me sorely. Nevertheless,
I will put them on, for it behoveth a maiden to be neatly
apparelled at all seasons.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> (<i>turning&mdash;she starts</i>). Geoffrey! Oh, Geoffrey! (<i>She
rushes towards him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Mistress Dorothy, I am right glad to hold thy little
hand once more. I have had this moment in view for many,
many months!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And I too, Master Geoffrey;&mdash;and oh, I am indeed
rejoiced!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> How thou art grown! A woman! By my right hand,
a very woman!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Yes, Master Geoffrey, I am a woman now!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> And a fair one, Mistress Dorothy! (<i>She turns.</i>) Nay,
’tis but truth; and truth is made to be told. May I not say
that thou art fair?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Yes, Master Geoffrey, if thou thinkest so in good sooth.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> In good sooth I do! It is strange to be back in the
old village again, after three years of blue water. And yet it
seems but yesterday that we tossed hay together in the five-acre
field.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I think the time must speed more swiftly with those
who seek their fortunes in distant lands, for though I have
been happy and full of content, yet it seemeth more than three
years since thy departure.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Yet barely three years have gone.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> (<i>sighing</i>). It seemeth more.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> The time hath sped with me despite the long night
watches and the never-ending days of a calm tropical sea; for
no hour is so long but that I can fill it with thoughts of thee,
Mistress Dorothy.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> I am rejoiced to know this, for my mind has often
dwelt on thy fortunes. Many a time, when the old forge
rocked in the wintry gale, my heart has been sad for thee, and
I have lain awake weeping and praying for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> For me?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> For all who go down to the sea in ships.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> In truth, if the sea had no other charm I would be a
sailor, that I might have thy prayers, Mistress Dorothy.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay, but if it consisted with thy duty to abandon thy
perilous calling, and bide here with us for ever, my poor prayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
would still be thine, Master Geoffrey. But thou lovest the sea.
(<i>Sighing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> All sailors love the sea.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> It is strange, for the sea is cold and cruel and fierce,
and many brave men are yearly swallowed up of it.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Dorothy, I love the sea dearly. There is but one love
that is stronger in my heart&mdash;one love for which I would yield
it up for ever and ever. Dear Dorothy, I have loved thee,
boy and man, for ten years past; and I shall love thee, come
what may, through my life. I came here to-day to tell thee
this. I thought how to say it, but all that I thought of is
gone&mdash;it’s my heart that’s speaking now and not my tongue.
Bear with me, Dorothy, for every hope of my life&mdash;every
waking and sleeping dream of ten years past&mdash;is in the words
I’m speaking now.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, Geoffrey&mdash;Geoffrey! I know not what to say!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Fear not for thy father, for I will quit the sea. Sir
Jasper has offered to make me his secretary, and that is why I
have come. But say nay, and I must needs go to sea again.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, Geoffrey&mdash;let me think&mdash;let me think! Do I
love thee? I cannot say. It may be that I do&mdash;and yet&mdash;thou
must not go to sea! Oh, I have given no thought to it.
Truly thou art dear to me, for I am rejoiced when thou comest,
and I am sorely grieved when thou goest. Is that love?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Dorothy, let us inquire into this.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Right willingly, for if I love thee I would fain know it,
that I might gladden thine heart by telling thee so.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Then attend to me, sweetheart, while I paint a picture
for thee. We will suppose that I have given up the sea&mdash;that
I have bought a little farm near at hand, and that I have come
to live here, close to thee and thy father, for the rest of my
life. Canst thou see the picture I am painting?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Ay. It is a pleasant picture.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Living here, close to thee, I naturally see thee very
often.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> (<i>pleased</i>). Every day?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Twice&mdash;maybe thrice&mdash;a day&mdash;for my horses need
much shoeing, and I always bring them to the forge myself.
Is that pleasant?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Very pleasant. And on Sabbath thou takest me to
church?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Ay, save only when some other village gallant is
beforehand with me and offers to escort thee thither, and in such
case I am fain to take Farmer Such-a-one’s daughter instead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay, that were needless, for I would have no other
escort than thou.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Yet it behoves one to be neighbourly, and if Farmer
Such-a-one says to me, “Come and see Susan, for she’s lonely
and wants cheering”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Susan?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> That’s the farmer’s daughter.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Is she fair?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Very fair. What then?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Why, then, thou wouldst not go.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> (<i>slyly</i>). And wherefore not?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Wherefore not? Oh, well, wherefore not indeed!
Go to Susan if thou wilt, Geoffrey. It is not for me to hinder
thee!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Well, then, I would <i>not</i> go. And so we live on&mdash;happy&mdash;very,
very happy, for, say a year. But a change is at hand.
My crops fail, my cattle die, and one evil night my homestead
is burnt to the ground, and I am penniless!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> So there is nothing for it but to go to sea again, for
three long years!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> No, no, Geoffrey&mdash;oh no!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> The time of parting draws near&mdash;a few weeks&mdash;a few
days&mdash;a few hours. These few hours we have passed in silence,
sitting hand in hand, thou and I. There are tears in my eyes,
though I strive to check them, and there are sad thoughts in
thine heart, also. Well, at last the horse is at the door, and it
is time to go. I am at thy porch&mdash;one foot in stirrup&mdash;one
hurried “God-speed”&mdash;and&mdash;I am gone!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh no, no, Geoffrey. I cannot bear it.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Months pass by and no news of me. The village
seems blank at first without me, the walks to church seem long
and lonely, and the evenings sad and cheerless. At last come
tidings of a wrecked ship&mdash;thine heart beats quickly, for the

<p><i>Geof.</i> Passing happy. (<i>He places a ring on her finger.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, Geoffrey, what is this?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> A ring that I have brought thee from Venice, where
there are cunning workers in such matters. Let it stay there
in earnest of another ring of plainer workmanship that is not
beyond the craft of our English goldsmiths to fashion.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But I know not if I may wear it. It is a vanity&mdash;but
it is very beautiful. See how it shineth! Oh, pity that I may
not wear it, for in truth it is very beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Thou hast a silver chain with thy mother’s locket on
thy neck. Wear it on thy chain. Will it be a vanity if it is
Concealed beneath thy kerchief?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay; for none will know of it. (<i>Withdraws a silver
locket from her bosom</i>). See, the clasp will not hold them both.
Stay! the locket shall be thine, and thy ring shall take its
place. (<i>Detaches locket and gives it to him. He kisses her.</i>)</p>

man. It was to be, and ’twould better fit me to rejoice that
thou hast found a brave and honest man to tend thee when
I am gone. Get thee within, and dry thine eyes. I’ll do thy
weeping for thee, Dorothy! (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> into the cottage.</i>)
It’s come sudden, my lad, it’s come sudden, and I doan’t rightly
know how to shift wi’out her. She’s been more than life to
me, Dolly has. I was a hard and bitter man when she was
left with me fourteen year since,&mdash;for I’d been cruelly warped&mdash;cruelly
warped. But when things are at their worst, like as not
they’ll mend; and from the time my darling was sent to me
(by a miracle as I then thought, for I’d been brought up ’mong
folk as see a miracle in ’most everything) a change crep’ over
me, and bit by bit my cruel old heart growed soft again. I was
a foul-tongued fellow then, but I couldna swear afore an angel
come straight from heaven. I was cruel and hard, but I
couldna sit glowerin’ at mankind wi’ her little arms round my
neck, and her soft cheek agin’ my wicked old face. Then it
come about that Dolly must be taught her Bible; but I’d no
Bible&mdash;so, wi’ a shamefaced lie on my tongue, I borrowed a
good book, and we spelt it out together. And many’s the time
as the old half-forgotten words come back to me, bit by bit,
and I called to mind when I’d first learnt ’em as a child. I laid
my head down on the book, and wept like a woman. And as
it was for me (God help me!) to teach her right from wrong,
I learnt as I taught, and the Light come to us together&mdash;the
old man and the little child&mdash;and as she growed in knowledge,
my right self growed in strength&mdash;and such as I am&mdash;hale,
hearty, and happy&mdash;livin’ by the sweat o’ my brow&mdash;owin’ no
man, fearin’ none, and lovin’ all, why she has made me, God
bless her!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> And thou hast never seen her father since?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> No; though for years I never passed a strange face but
I peered into it&mdash;for I knowed every line o’ his, though I never
heerd his name. Knowed it! Why, it burnt in my eyeballs,
so that I see it in the dark! I seed it everywhere&mdash;I seed it
in the forge, and be sure I raked it out!&mdash;I seed it red-hot on my
anvil, and be sure I hammered with a will! After a while
(but it was a weary while!) the thought come that mayhap he
had perished in the gale, so I thought less about it; and Dolly
seemed more like my own. Yet the old fear comes back, odd
times, and, oh, Geoffrey, it’s like enough she’ll be taken from
me yet.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Good morrow, pretty Mistress Dorothy! We have not
forgotten one another, I see! And how has time sped with
thee since I saw thee last? Has it crept, crawled, drawled,
dragged, and dawdled for lack of a certain merry old man who
whiled away a certain half-hour with thee two months since
with curious quip, quaint retort, and surprising conundrum?
Dost thou remember that half-hour, Dorothy? <i>I</i> do. In the
course of it I said many rare things to thee, complimentary and
insinuating things of amatory significance and connubial import,
neatly disguised, or, as one may say, embalmed, in an
outer husk of delicate epigram. And thou didst listen! Ye
gods! how thou didst listen! I love a good listener.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Sir, I do indeed remember your coming; but as for
your sayings, I was silent, for I understood them not. Is&mdash;is
Sir Jasper at hand?</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dan’l Druce</span>, unobserved, at back.</i></p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> He will be here anon. Some village clowns are plaguing
him with an address&mdash;a scurvy long one, and writ in very false
jingle. I heard the first lines thereof; it began:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>It did so move me to laughter that Sir Jasper, who hath no
sense of the ridiculous, did order me to ride on. But I doubt
not that even he is laughing heartily thereat, by this time!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>who has heard the last few lines</i>). Nay, sir, but if Sir
Jasper deserve all that men say of him, he will scarcely hold in
scorn that which poor humble folks have writ in his praise.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span></i>). Who is this old gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> I am Dan’l Druce,&mdash;no gentleman, but a hard-working
blacksmith, very much at your honour’s service. (<i>Looking at
him.</i>) I was away when you last come to the village, yet I
think I’ve seen your honour’s face.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> It is very like. It is a striking face. I don’t like it
myself, but others do, so I yield to the majority. It is a good
face.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> I cannot recall where I have seen it.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> It signifieth not&mdash;thou wilt have plenty of time to
study it,&mdash;for thou wilt see it every quarter-day whilst thou
livest. Despite its inherent goodliness, it will come to be a face
of evil significance to thee, speaking, as it will, of raised rents,
rapid distraint, and uncompromising ejection!</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Dan.</i> I’m a punctual tenant, sir, and I fear no man.
Dorothy, draw this gentleman some ale while I look to his

<p><i>Reu.</i> And take thy time, for we are very well thus, eh,
Dorothy? (<i><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> going.</i>) Nay, do not go. Never heed the
ale. I’d rather take a long look at thy pretty face than a long
pull at thy village brew. The one is sweet, I know&mdash;the other
is sour, I’ll swear. Come hither, Dorothy.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay, sir, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> I have news to tell thee, Dorothy&mdash;thou art a kind of
wife of mine, for I have, in a manner, married thee&mdash;intellectually
and reflectively; or, as one may say, in a mental or
moral sense have I married thee. I have, as it were, invented
thee as my wife, and the invention is none the less mine
because a scurvy mechanic (to wit, the parson) hath not yet
hammered in the rivets. (<i>Aside.</i>) A quip!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Sir, I do not rightly understand thy talk, but it
seemeth to me that thou makest jest of solemn things.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Nay, this time I am in earnest. If thou wilt be my

anecdote, tales of court and camp, tales of love, hate, and intrigue,
tales of murder, rapine, and theft, merry tales, sad tales,
long tales, short tales, quip, crank, retort, repartee, and rejoinder,

and thou shalt find but one fault with me&mdash;that I clog
thee with sweets! (<i>Takes her round waist.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Harkee, sirrah. Let bygones go by. Times are
changed with me, as thou knowest well, and if thou valuest
thy stewardship, adapt thy morals to those of thy master. If
thou sayest or doest aught to anger this gentle maiden, I’ll lay
my whip across thy shoulders, as I have done ofttimes ere this.</p>

not to be held accountable for his deeds.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>laughing heartily</i>). Why, in truth, I sometimes think
so too. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Reuben</span>.</i>) Get thee to the inn, sir; we shall lie
there to-night: as for the whipping, why the maiden’s intercession

be sworn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> He is kind to me and to all. In very truth I think he
must be the best man in the whole world.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> And thou tendest him very carefully?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Yes, indeed. I am with him from the rising of the sun
to the going down thereof; and we love each other with a love
that passeth all telling.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). Dorothy, I once had a little child who
promised to grow up to be just such a pretty lass as thou. But
we&mdash;we were separated many years ago, and I have never seen
her since!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, poor gentleman!</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Poor, indeed&mdash;for I declare to thee, Dorothy, that I
would give all my substance, were it ten times what it is, to
have her with me in my old age. But though I have sought
her high and low for many a weary year, I have found no
tidings of her; and so I must needs go on to the end&mdash;a solitary
old man, uncared for and alone! There’s a doleful tale, little
Dorothy!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Indeed, it is passing sad, and my heart bleeds for your
worship. I am even more grieved for thy daughter, who hath
lost the fostering care and guidance of so worthy a gentleman.
I am sure she would have loved your worship very dearly.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>moved</i>). I know not. It may be so, and yet&mdash;I showed
myself but a careless and unloving father to her when we were
parted. But her mother died of grief&mdash;and&mdash;and I would fain
make amends, I would fain make amends! Yes, Dorothy, it
would have gone hard with me but I would have made her
love me!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dan’l</span>.</i></p>

<p>Who is this good fellow?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> It is my father, of whom I spoke unto your worship.
Father, this is Sir Jasper Combe.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>heartily</i>). At your worship’s service, Sir Jasper. I’ve
naught to say, sir, but what’s been said by better men&mdash;“Welcome
to Combe-Raven.” I’ll go bail my Dorothy’s said it
already.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Indeed, she has given me a very kindly greeting,
Master Druce. I was telling thy daughter how I came to be
wifeless and childless; and how, desolate as I am, I envy thee
thy good fortune in having so fair a little nurse to cosset thee
in thine old age. Take heed, though, that she be not taken
from thee, and at brief notice too, one of these days! (<i>During
this speech <span class="smcap">Dan’l</span> has gradually recognized <span class="smcap">Sir Jasper</span>. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>

care that she be not taken from thee one of these days.</p>

<p><i>Dan</i> (<i>still stupefied</i>). By whom? Taken from me by whom?</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Oh, never fear me, Dan’l&mdash;by some far
younger man than I!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Ay, ay&mdash;to be married. Ah, mebbe, mebbe!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Father, is aught amiss?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). No, lass, no; take no heed o’ me.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> (<i>leading him to stool</i>). My father hath been working in
the heat of the day, and he is faint.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Yes, I’ve&mdash;I’ve been working hard. Take no heed o’
me. I’m better now. I’m an old man, and weaker than o’
yore. Take no heed.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> I’ll send thee strong wines that shall put the courage
and strength of youth into thine old heart, Dan’l Druce.
There, there, bear up, man. And Dorothy must come to the
Hall, Dan’l. Old Bridget shall take good care of her; and
I own I should like to see how the old place would shine in the
sunlight shed by so fair a little lady. There, be of good cheer,
man; I did but jest when I spake of thy daughter leaving thee.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Ay, ay&mdash;thou didst but jest, eh?</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Why, to be sure. (<i>Aside.</i>) To think that those few
light words should have so shaken him. (<i>Looking at <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.</i>)
Well, I can understand it. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Dan’l</span>, after a pause.</i>) Master
Druce, I’m an old man now, and a very grave and sober old man
too. I had a fair young wife once; she had eyes like thy
daughter’s eyes. There’s a strange whim in my head, but I’m
an old man, and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;may I kiss thy little daughter?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>much moved</i>). Ay, ay, thou&mdash;thou mayst kiss her

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, father, didst thou hear? I am to go to the Hall! I
have heard that it is a goodly place, as big as a village, and
bravely decked with velvets and rich silks and pictures and
vast mirrors! Oh, I long to see the mirrors! Then the gardens
are beyond everything fair to view, and there are deer in the
park, and a spacious lake, and carriages and horses too! Oh,
it must be brave to live in so fair a place!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay, father&mdash;but indeed I envy not Sir Jasper. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
grieve to think how solitary the poor gentleman must be, all
alone in so vast a house, with neither wife nor child to solace
him in his old age!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). Did he tell thee of his child?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Ay, speaking gravely, yet kindly, as of a sorrow still
unhealed. And when he told me how he lost the maiden many
years ago, and how he has vainly sought her ever since, my
heart yearned to him, for the tears glistened in his eyes. Methinks
a daughter must needs love such a father, for he is a
noble gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Nay, thou knowest him not. He did not deal rightly
by the girl. He left her to perish&mdash;to perish, Dolly&mdash;that he
might save his own life. He is rightly served. The sins of his
youth are visited upon him in his old age. It is just, it is just.
<i>I</i> would not have quitted <i>thee</i>, my child, my child!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> In truth, I am very sure of that. I cannot think that
there is in this world peril or necessity so dire as to part us twain!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Never!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span></p>

right-doing man,&mdash;and it’s not for a boy like me to
shape thy course.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Why, what dost thou mean?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> If this man, Sir Jasper Combe, is indeed her father&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Her father? He cast her from him! He left her to
perish! Her father? Heaven had given him the richest
treasure that Heaven can give, and he flung it into my lap as
he’d fling a coin to a beggar! The trust that he forsook I took
up. The child that he plucked from his bosom I took to mine.
There let it bide, Geoffrey Wynyard, there let it bide!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Yet bethink thee&mdash;the poor lone gentleman hath paid
a bitter price for his wickedness; and though he did a cruel
and reckless thing in abandoning her, yet grief and penitence
have wrought a great change in him, and the laws of Heaven
and of man give him a right over her that none may gainsay.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> And have I earned no right in these fourteen years?
Why, think what she is to me! what we are to each other!
She has vouchsafed me her love, and for it I kneel down and
worship her! She has turned my heart to man, and for it I
kneel down and worship her. She has shown me the Truth,
and for it I kneel down and worship her. We are life and
death, body and soul, all in all to each other. And now thou
wouldst have me say to this unworthy man, “Here is the
daughter thou didst abandon in thy peril. For fourteen years
I have reared her as mine own; but as thou didst beget her,
so take her; I did but hold her in trust for thee that thou
mightest reclaim her when it seemed good to thee to do so.”
It may be that this is my duty, Geoffrey Wynyard; but I
canna do it&mdash;I canna do it.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Thy case is a hard one&mdash;it is not for me to judge.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Thou hast rightly said it is not for thee to judge.
Moreover, bethink thee, thou lovest her. If this man, her
father, reclaims her, he will take her from thee, and raise her
to a station as far above thine as thine is above hers.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Art thou so sure that Sir Jasper is indeed her father?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> That’s true! that’s very true! I know not that he is
her father! I cannot tell that. We judge men by their deeds,
Geoffrey, not their words; and he may have lied. Come, that’s
well thought of, Geoffrey! But we’ll go hence, Dolly and I&mdash;no
one shall know&mdash;thou shalt join us later; and when thou
and she are married, and he cannot take her from thee, why
then, maybe, we’ll&mdash;oh, Geoffrey&mdash;thou wilt not betray me&mdash;thou
wilt not betray <i>her</i>! Promise me that!</p>

<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> In truth I am in a sore strait; for Sir Jasper is a man
of proud blood, who would laugh to scorn such humble love as
mine. And oh, Dorothy, if thou art taken from me, why, my
life may go too! And if I cannot yield thee up, how can I ask
<i>him</i> to do so! Oh, Dan’l Druce, Dan’l Druce, my heart is with
thine in this thing, and I’ll keep thy secret, never fear!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Reuben</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Why, whom have we here in Dorothy’s house? A
whelp&mdash;a very whelp, cur, or puppy, to be beckoned to, whistled
to, frowned at, scowled at, whipped with whips, beaten with
sticks, and slapped with the flat of hand!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Your servant, sir. Who are you?</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Why, sir, I am an old horse-soldier, and yet not so
very old neither but that I can wield quarter-staff or give the
Cornish fling as well as another. No mere trooper neither, but
a sergeant of horse, if you please; and one that hath cut his
way through war’s intestine, as a hot knife cuts butter. One
who has so snicked, chipped, chopped, slashed, cut, drilled, and
carbonaded, with sword, with pistolet, with mace, with arquebus,
with petronel, and with what-not, that he’d make no more
of passing a rapier through that boy’s body of thine than of
spitting a penny herring. And now, sir, who are <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Why, sir, I am a sailor, and I hate brag.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Come, come, civil words, young master, lest we quarrel;
and when <i>I</i> quarrel, sextons lay in tolling grease and grave-diggers
strip to their work. Dost thou know this Dan’l Druce?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> I do.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> A comfortable old man, they tell me, and one who can
portion his pretty Dorothy. Pretty Dorothy and I are very
good friends. She listens when I talk, which many won’t.
(<i><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span> makes an angry gesture.</i>) And talking of pretty
Dorothy, we have here a bauble or locket, or, as one may say,
a trinket that belongeth to her, I’ll go bail. (<i>Picking up locket
which <span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span> dropped.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Sir, that locket is mine.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> It is very like&mdash;it is very like, yet for that I have but
thy word. I care for no man’s word&mdash;no, not even for mine
own, for though it is as good as another’s, yet it is worth
nothing. If the trinket be thine, describe it with circumstance,
and I will give it up to thee.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> It is fashioned like a heart, and bears an inscription
“To the best loved of all,” and it is dated seventeen years
since. It is a love-token, sir, and I desire you to yield it up
without further parley.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> (<i>who has recognized it</i>). Why, surely, I should know
this locket well. From whom did you receive it?</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> (<i>taking it from him</i>). That is a question that I have no
will to answer. It is a token of betrothal&mdash;let that suffice.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> But it don’t suffice. Do you know who I am? I am
bailiff to Sir Jasper Combe&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Sir Jasper Combe!</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Ay; and I recognize that locket as one that he placed
about the neck of his missing daughter the very day he
abandoned her. Come, sir, from whom did you receive it? It
is a love-token&mdash;a token of betrothal. To whom are you
betrothed?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> So, Geoffrey Wynward! The blow that is to bring me

<p><i>Dor.</i> Father! father! hurt him not!</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Master Druce&mdash;indeed, I knew not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Thou knewest not! Will there be more mercy in this
man’s heart because thou knewest not? Will the last years of
my poor old lonely life be less desolate because thou knewest
not?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, father, father, what sayest thou?</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Dan.</i> Nay, girl, stop me not! (<i>Taking up a hammer.</i>)
Geoffrey Wynyard, there are injuries that laws can measure,
and laws are made for ’em. There are injuries that no laws
can measure, and wi’ them we deal ourselves, and wreak our
vengeance wi’ our own right hands. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>, who interposes.</i>)
Stand aside, girl; I’m a weak old man, but there’s devil

<p><i>Dor.</i> No, no, father, yield not to thy wrath&mdash;he hath denied

Oh, harm him not, oh, harm him not! Pardon him, even as
I pardon him; and let him depart in peace.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>with a violent effort to be calm</i>). Ay, ay, thou recallest
me to myself. He hath dealt lightly wi’ thy love&mdash;and there’s
an end. Heed not the words I spake; they were empty words,
and had no meaning&mdash;heed them not. Geoffrey Wynyard,
thou hast spoken lightly of my child, thou hast denied her
who gave thee her heart. It was ill done. Quit my roof and
let me see thee no more. I&mdash;I pardon thee. Go.</p>

<p><i>Geof.</i> Master Druce, have pity, for my tongue is tied&mdash;I&mdash;I

<p class="scene-open"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Interior of <span class="smcap">Druce’s</span> cottage. Time, evening. <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>
is discovered pale and weak, sitting by the fire, reading an
old and tattered letter, her head resting in her hand. <span class="smcap">Dan’l</span>
discovered at back&mdash;he has a bundle and stick in his hand
as if prepared for a journey. He is pale and anxious.</i></p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Eventide, and he’s not yet come to claim her. It’s
weary waitin’ for a blow that is to fall, and we’ll wait no longer.
It’s hard to have to creep away from the old forge, like a thief
in the night, and begin the weary struggle anew, God knows
where! But that it should ha’ come through him whom I
loved like a son, and whom I’d ha’ taken to my heart as a son&mdash;it’s
doubly hard it should ha’ come through him! (<i>Looking at
<span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.</i>) Poor maiden! She thinks him false to her. Well,
it’s better so. I’ll keep that thought alive; ’twill account for
much that I may not explain. One word would lift that sorrow
from her gentle heart; but it must not be spoke&mdash;not yet&mdash;not
yet! (<i>Aloud.</i>) What art thou readin’, lass?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> It is the letter he wrote to me from Morocco, two years
since. I am bidding farewell to it ere I destroy it&mdash;for he is
betrothed to another, and I may not keep it now. He spake to
me in jest! Oh, father, it’s hard to bear.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Ay, ay&mdash;hard to bear, Dolly&mdash;hard to bear.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> And to vaunt his unfaithfulness in the ears of a very
stranger! It was a cruel boast&mdash;for I loved him with all my
heart!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Better learn the truth now than later&mdash;as I did&mdash;as I
did. Early fall, light fall, Dolly. When my sorrow come it
had like to ha’ crushed the life out o’ me&mdash;but thou’rt young,
my child, and time will heal thy wound.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> If he had but known how I loved him,&mdash;but in truth I
knew it not myself. It is hard to bear, for he had truth in his
face, and I doubted nothing!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Trust no faces, Dolly&mdash;they lie&mdash;they lie.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Nay, but it is not like thee to say these bitter things.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> More like me than thou wottest of, Dolly. I have told
thee what I was afore thou camest to me&mdash;the past fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
year are gone like a dream, and I’m wakin’ from it, Dolly, I’m
wakin’ from it. (<i>Takes up his bundle.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Why, father, art thou going away?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Ay, lass,&mdash;we’re both goin’ away.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> (<i>surprised</i>). To-night?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> To-night. Make thy bundle, for time presses.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> But whither are we going?</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Whither? What odds whither, so that we leave this
place! Out into the cold world&mdash;it matters little where. Thou’lt
fret here&mdash;it’s better to take thee hence&mdash;for a time&mdash;only for
a time. Get thy bundle quickly&mdash;take all thou hast. I’ll tell
thee more anon&mdash;we’ve no time to lose.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Dor.</i> (<i>going</i>). As thou wilt, father. (<i>Aside.</i>) To-night! Oh,
Geoffrey, Geoffrey, this is indeed the end!</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Poor child, poor child! My heart smites me for
deceivin’ her&mdash;for harmful as he’s been to me, he never had
thought for aught but her. I’m a’most sorry I was so rough
wi’ him&mdash;he did not know&mdash;but the harm’s done, and there’s
no undoin’ it! So, old forge, the time has come when thou
and I must part for ever! May he who comes arter me have
as good cause to love thee as I have, for I have been ower happy
here! (<i>Weeping.</i>)</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i><span class="smcap">Reuben</span> has entered and overheard the last few lines.</i></p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> What, Dan’l Druce on the eve of a journey? Nay,
thou’lt take no journey to-night, I promise thee. Unstrap thy
pack and burn thy staff; for thou’lt eat here, drink here, sleep
here, make money here, lose money here, laugh with joy, frown
with anger, groan with pain&mdash;mope here, sicken here, dwindle
here, and die here; take an old warrior’s word for it!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Reuben Haines, art thou here to take her from me?</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> No, Master Dan’l, I am <i>not</i> here to take her from thee&mdash;and
yet, in a sense, <i>yes</i>, Master Dan’l, I <i>am</i> here to take her
from thee. Weigh these words well, and store them away in
the museum of thy mind, for they are rare words&mdash;containing,
as they do, truth commingled with wisdom, which is an observable
union, as these qualities consort but rarely together&mdash;for he
hath no wisdom who tells the plain truth, and he hath no need
to tell the plain truth who hath wisdom enough to do without
it. It is a paradox.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). To the devil wi’ thy chop-logic, I canna
wait for it. Speak out, and let me know the best and the worst.
Does&mdash;does thy master know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> He does <i>not</i> know, as yet. And why does he not
know? Because the mighty should be merciful&mdash;and I have
refrained.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> If thou art not mocking at my sorrow, speak plainly.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Then observe. I am a Potent Magician, or, if thou
preferrest it, a Benevolent Fairy, who hath certain gifts to dispose
of. On the one hand, I have Family Union, Domestic
Happiness, and Snug Old Age&mdash;on the other, Blank Misery,
Abject Despair, and Desolation, utter and complete. Which
shall I give to Sir Jasper, and which to thee? Now, I am a
pleasant old gentleman&mdash;well to do&mdash;not so very old neither,
yet old enough to marry. Dorothy and I are good friends; she
listens to me when I talk, which many won’t; it is a good sign
and augurs well, for I love a good listener. How say you?
Come, give me <i>thy</i> daughter, and I will give thee Sir Jasper’s
daughter. (<i>Aside.</i>) Ha! ha! It is neatly put. It is a quip.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Give thee my Dorothy! (<i>With an effort to be calm.</i>)
No, no&mdash;it canna be&mdash;she is promised. True, I drove him
forth; but still she loves him. No, no&mdash;I canna do that&mdash;I
canna do that!</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Reflect. Sir Jasper will take her from thee for ever&mdash;thou
wilt never behold her again. He will drive thee from thy
forge, and thou wilt be a desolate old vagabond, while she is
learning day by day to forget thee, and to give her love to
another. Thou refusest? It is well done. Brave old man!
Thou shrinkest not from the troubles that environ thee, though
they threaten to crush thee utterly; and so I say, brave old
man! (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Nay&mdash;stay&mdash;one moment&mdash;give me time to think.
How am I to do this thing? And yet&mdash;I will consent&mdash;that
is, if Dorothy will. I will ask her&mdash;nay, I will persuade her.
God forgive me!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.</i></p>

man&mdash;this Reuben Haines&mdash;he loveth thee, and would make
thee his wife.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Oh, father&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Ay, I know what thou wouldst say&mdash;thou lovest

of thee&mdash;he did deny thee&mdash;he loveth other women; thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
didst hear him say as much. See, this man will love thee better
than Geoffrey. He&mdash;he is not a young man&mdash;he is of sober age,
and a man of good substance. Oh, Dorothy, my child, have

<p><i>Dan.</i> Dorothy, my little girl&mdash;for a reason which I canna tell
thee, it concerns my life&mdash;ay, my life&mdash;that thou shouldst take

I have asked naught of thee till now. Oh, my child, it is for
thine happiness as well as for mine. If thou didst but know! If
thou didst but know!</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Behold, maiden, I am worth consideration. I am not
as other old men are. In all but years I am a boy&mdash;a very boy.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> My father, I know naught of the sorrow that hangs
over thee, but it must needs be heavy if thou canst suffer this
man to say this thing to me!</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Dorothy&mdash;have patience; if to yield up my life would
serve thee, I would yield it, ten times told&mdash;the time may soon
come when I shall prove thee this&mdash;for I canna live alone!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Father, I know naught of this man but what is ill&mdash;nevertheless,
as thou hast been to me as my father, and I to
thee as thy child, bound in all lawful things to obey thee, so
will I obey thee even in this. Sir, I cannot love you, for my
heart is given, but if my father bids me, I must needs do his
bidding. (<i>Kneels.</i>) Oh, my father, if the breaking of my heart
can save thee, it is thine to break!</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> It is dutifully spoken. It is a bargain. Give me thine
hand on it, Dan’l Druce. Set thine heart at rest&mdash;it is settled.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>furiously</i>). Ay, it is settled. Get thee hence, now and

<p><i>Jas.</i> Yet it would seem that, having learnt it, thou wouldst
nevertheless have fled with her, had not this good fellow arrested
thy flight.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> I have naught to say that your honour’s kind heart
will not more fitly say for me. We love one another dearly.
Truly in the bitterness of my grief I had thought to flee with
her, but my better self prevailed, and I stayed.</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Credit him not, sir, for he lieth. He was in the very
nick of departure when I interposed, and with stern upbraiding,
withering invective, and threat of instant death, did bid him
await your honour’s commands. The palsied coward trembled
and obeyed.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Nay, sir, this man&mdash;this traitorous man&mdash;offered to
keep the matter from you for ever if I would consent to give
him the child to wife. She will herself bear witness to this.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Reuben</span></i>). Art thou indeed guilty of this treachery?</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> Why, sir, there is a measure of truth even in this
fellow’s speech, inasmuch as I did indeed say it; but (herein
lurks the humour of the thing) I did it but to try him. It was,
as it were, a subtle essay or delicate test, prepared and carried
out to the life with much ingenuity, in pursuit of the grandest
of all studies&mdash;the conduct of a man under the influence of
extraordinary temptation. I am a philosopher!</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Thy philosophy shall be severely tried. Deliver thy
books and papers to Master Geoffrey Wynyard, whom I appoint
steward in thy place. Thy stewardship is at an end. Begone!</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> But, sir&mdash;consider&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Begone, I say, and let me see thee no more!</p>

<p><i>Reu.</i> (<i>at door</i>). I am a philosopher!</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Begone! (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Reuben</span>, dolefully.</i>) Now, Dan’l Druce,
if thou hast aught to say in defence of thy conduct, I am prepared
to hear it.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Aught to say? No, sir, I’ve naught to say worth saying.
Thou’st seen the maiden&mdash;thou’st seen how fair she is&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>how
good she is&mdash;how pure, and gentle, and tender, and true
she is. That says more for me than I could say for myself.
She softened my stubborn heart&mdash;she made me a man. I’ve
learnt to look on her as my daughter&mdash;she on me as her father.
We’ve bin all in all to each other; and at the thought o’ losin’
of her my poor old heart’s ’most broken in twain. I dunno as
I’ve any more for to say. No, sir, that’s all. (<i>Sighing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> I am sorry for you&mdash;but you have brought this grief
upon yourself; you have been guilty of gross injustice both to
myself and to the girl.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>furious</i>). What!</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Knowing as you did that enquiries would certainly be
made for the child, you nevertheless stole away from the town,
and left no clue whatever as to your destination.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Knowin’ as I did! How did I know&mdash;what was there
for to tell me? Was it the love that her father showed for
her when he left her to perish on that stormy Norfolk coast?
Did that reckless profligate set such value on his treasure as to
make it so sure he would ever come for it agen? Why, he set
<i>his</i> life afore hers! That he might live he left her to die!
Why, she was well quit of such a father! Take her from me,
Jasper Combe, if thou’st the heart to do it&mdash;but do it wi’ a
shut mouth; for God knows, with all my sins&mdash;and they’re
many&mdash;I done my duty by her!</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Dan’l, I spake harshly&mdash;I am sorry for it. You are
right. That she was not my own child, but a step-child,
matters nothing. I loved her mother dearly. It was my duty
to protect the child, and I basely forsook my trust. But for
this misdeed I have suffered bitterly. It killed her poor mother,
who loved her beyond measure, and on her deathbed I swore to
search out the child that I might make amends&mdash;and now that
after many years of weary searching I have found her, shall I
yield her up, even to you? Come, Dan’l, be just, and ask yourself
this.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> I have nowt to say agin it, sir. It’s right&mdash;but it’s
ower hard&mdash;it’s ower hard! (<i>Calls.</i>) Dorothy, my child, come
hither.</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.</i></p>

<p>(<i>To <span class="smcap">Sir Jasper</span>.</i>) I ask your pardon, sir, if I call her my child
still, for she’s bin more than that to me! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.</i>)
Dolly, my lass, there’s a change in store for thee&mdash;a grand
change; thou’rt a lady, ay, a great lady, too. I allers knowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
thou wast a lady. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Sir Jasper</span>.</i>) She doan’t talk like us
common folk, sir! This gentleman, Sir Jasper Combe&mdash;he’s
come to claim thee&mdash;he’s thy father, Dolly&mdash;think o’ that! And
he’s&mdash;he’s goin’ to take thee from me&mdash;only to Combe-Raven,
Dolly, where I’ll come and see thee often. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Sir Jasper</span>.</i>)
Thou’lt let me come and see her odd times? (<i>To <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.</i>) And
thou’lt come and see me, and there’ll be grand doins then, eh,
Dolly? There, there, go to thy father&mdash;he’ll be a kind father
to thee, and he’ll love thee well, never doubt it&mdash;and&mdash;and I
shall love thee too, and thou’lt have two fathers ’stead o’ one,
Dolly, that’s all! (<i>She is about to speak.</i>) Doan’t speak!
doan’t speak; for God’s sake, doan’t speak! (<i>He rushes out.
<span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> stands dumb with surprise.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Dorothy, my child, I am indeed he who should stand to
thee in the place of a father. I know that I seem to thee to be
doing a hard thing&mdash;for thou hast learnt to love him, and he
hath earned thy love. But, Dorothy, I am childless and alone,
wealthy, honoured, and of good repute, yet alone in my old age.
Dorothy, come to me&mdash;come to me!</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> (<i>who has been sobbing through this speech</i>). Oh, sir, forgive
me if I seem to speak thoughtlessly, for I am but a poor
untaught girl, and I know not how to reply. He has been so
good to me, and I love him with all the love of my heart. Oh,
sir, it cannot be that after these long years of tender love I am
to be taken from him now. Oh, it will kill him! Have pity
on him, sir, for it will kill him! I cannot leave him now. I
am the very light of his eyes&mdash;the very heart of his life (<i>sobbing</i>)&mdash;I
cannot leave him now! Oh, sir, if thou hast no care
for him, yet for the love of my mother have pity upon me!</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). I had thought my atonement was at an
end, but my bitterest punishment is yet to come, and I am to
suffer it at thy hands. So be it&mdash;it is just! Dorothy, my child,
whom I have sought so long, I will not break another heart.
Thou art free to go to him who has been more to thee than
many fathers.</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Heaven bless thee for those good words; they have
sown seed in my heart that will bear thee truer love than
could have come in many years passed away from him! Sir,
thou hast spared his life. When his wife left him it drove him
to the very verge of madness, and this last blow would have
ended his life!</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Did his wife leave him?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Alas! yes, many years since&mdash;before I was sent to him.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> And he loved her very dearly too?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> So dearly that he would have taken her to his heart if
she had returned to him&mdash;so dearly that he called me Dorothy
because he read her name in mine eyes.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> Dorothy! was that her name?</p>

<p><i>Dor.</i> Ay, Dorothy Marple, for that is rightly my father’s
name. But to save her good fame he gave out that he was
dead, and he took the name he now bears.</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> (<i>aside</i>). My sin has borne bitter fruit! Oh, Dan’l
Druce, give me thy pardon! Dorothy, for the sake of the
Dorothy who is dead, give me thy pardon!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dan’l Druce</span>.</i></p>

working on thee a deep and bitter injury. Take the

she has been thy daughter hitherto, so shall she be thy

<p><i>Dan.</i> (<i>amazed</i>). Why, sir&mdash;Dorothy, my child&mdash;is he not
goin’ to take thee from me?</p>

<p><i>Jas.</i> I have no right with her. She is thine, to bless thine
old age, and to bring thee comfort to the very last.</p>

<p><i>Dan.</i> Dorothy&mdash;my child&mdash;my child! (<i>Takes <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> in
his arms.</i>) Oh, sir, I know not how to bless thee for this
blessing!</p>

beyond the power of man to repair. Think of the deepest

place it to my account. (<i><span class="smcap">Dan’l</span> thunderstruck.</i>) If it lies
within thee to extend the hand of pardon to him who laid
waste thine home and made thy life desolate, read in my blighted

me in my old age. As I have sinned, so before Heaven I have
atoned!</p>

<p class="scene-open"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>A shabby but pretentious sitting-room in <span class="smcap">Colonel
O’Fipp’s</span> house. Breakfast laid. Enter <span class="smcap">Tom Cobb</span>, with
open letter in his hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I haven’t a penny&mdash;I haven’t the ghost of a prospect
of a penny. In debt everywhere, and now I’m told that judgment’s
been signed against me for &pound;250 by the cruellest Jew in
Christendom! Upon my soul, it’s enough to make a fellow shy
things about, I swear it is! But everything always <i>did</i> go
wrong with me, even before I was born, for I was always expected
to be a girl, and turned out something quite different,
and no fault of mine, I’m sure! (<i>Producing pistol.</i>) Oh, if
I was only quite, quite sure I knew how to load it, I’d blow
my brains out this minute! I would, upon my word and
honour!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Matilda</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Eh! and what good ’ld that do, dear?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> It would rid the world of an unhappy wretch. The
world’s a beast, and I hate it.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Then if you hate it, what d’ye want to be doing it a
good turn for? Sure it would be a bad bargain, lovey, for
<i>you’d</i> lose the world, whereas the world ’ld only lose <i>you</i>.
(<i>Takes pistol away from him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> There’s truth in that.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> If I was you, dear, I’d go on living to spite it.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, ain’t that small! Oh, ain’t that like a woman!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> And, after all, ye’re not so badly off. Don’t ye board
and lodge on nominal turr’ms with a rale cornel?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, that’s true enough.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> And ain’t ye engaged to a rale cornel’s daughter?
And isn’t <i>that</i> something to live for? (<i>Goes to table and cuts
bread and butter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>seated</i>). Oh, I’ve plenty to live <i>for</i>, but I’ve nothing
to live <i>on</i>. Upon my word, Matilda, when you come to think
of it, it <i>is</i> a most extraordinary thing that I can’t get any
patients! I’m a qualified practitioner, right enough! I’ve
passed the College of Surgeons!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> So have I, dear, often.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> You can’t be more a surgeon than I am, put it how
you will; but nobody seems to know it, and I’m sure I don’t
know how to tell ’em. I can’t send sandwich men about with
advertisements&mdash;the College wouldn’t like that. I can’t hang
placards out from a real colonel’s balcony, “Walk up, walk up,
this is the Shop for Amputations!” or, “To married couples
and others”&mdash;the Horse Guards wouldn’t like that. (<i>Taking up
carving-knife.</i>) Upon my word, Matilda, when I look at you,
and reflect that there isn’t an operation in the whole range of
practical surgery that I shouldn’t be delighted to perform upon
you at five minutes’ notice for nothing, why, it <i>does</i> seem a
most extraordinary thing that I can’t get any patients!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Colonel O’Fipp</span>, in seedy, showy dressing-gown.</i></p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Good mornin’, Thomas; Matilda, my own, the mornin’
to ye. (<i>Kisses her.</i>) Breakfast ready? That’s well. Good
appetite, Thomas? (<i>They sit to breakfast.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Tremendous. (<i>Taking an egg.</i>)</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Then I’ll spile it for ye. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Don’t crack
that egg till you’re sure ye’ll want it. (<i>Takes it from him.</i>)
Thomas Cobb, I’m goin’ to have a wurr’d or two with ye about
your prospects, sorr.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, Lord! (<i>Turns away from his breakfast.</i>)</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> When I gave my consint to yer engagement with me
beautiful and beloved daughter&mdash;&mdash; Don’t cry, my child.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> No, pa. (<i>Takes an egg.</i>)</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Ye tould me ye were about to purchase a practice;
and, like a simple old soldier, I believed ye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Sure, and so he was. Didn’t ye introduce him to Ben
Isaacs, and didn’t he lend him the money to do it?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Which your papa immediately exchanged for bills.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Which is another turr’m for money.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Another term for money?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Papa has always been accustomed to regard his I.O.U.’s
as currency.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Why, who do you suppose would sell me a practice for
a bundle of your I.O.U.’s?</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> My name, sorr, is considered in the City to be as good
for a thousand pounds as for a hundred.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Papa’s is one of the oldest names in the kingdom.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Yes, sorr. And let me tell ye it’s on some of the oldest
bills in the kingdom, too. Such is the value of my name that
I suppose I have renewed oftener than any man aloive! And
it isn’t every man that can say <i>that</i>!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> But when I try to discount your paper, capitalists
always say, “Who’s O’Fipp?” And when I tell ’em he’s a
colonel, they say, “What’s he a colonel of?”</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Colonel of a regiment, to be sure.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, but in what service?</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Never mind the surrvice, sorr. It was the 27th ridgment
of it. That’s enough for any man. There’s many a
surrvice besides the British surrvice, I believe, sorr?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, I believe there’s a good many.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> There’s the Spanish surrvice, sorr&mdash;and the Hungarian
surrvice&mdash;and the Italian surrvice, and the French surrvice, and
the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> And the dinner surrvice.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> And the Church Service.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> No, sorr. When a gintleman asks me my ridgment, he
has a right to know it, and I tell him at once. But when he asks
me in what surrvice, sorr, why that’s a piece of impertinent
curiosity, and I ask him “what the devil he means by it?”</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, I’m sure <i>I</i> don’t care; the regiment’s quite enough
for <i>me</i>. But then I ain’t a capitalist.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Well, sorr, let us come to the p’int. For two months
ye’ve been engaged to my lovely and accomplished daughter&mdash;&mdash; Don’t
cry, my love. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Matilda</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> No, pa. (<i>Takes an egg.</i>)</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> And ye’re as far from marrying her as iver. Now
during the last two months my poor child’s been wastin’ the
best years of her loife, and she can’t wait much longer.&mdash;Can
ye, Matilda?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> ’Deed, and I can’t then. I’m twenty-noine and a bit.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>O’Fi.</i> She’s twenty-noine&mdash;and a bit! Now it’s roight to
tell ye, and you too, Matilda, that a gintleman of good birth,
irreproachable morals, and a considerable command of ready
money, has done me the honour to propose for me daughter’s
hand. I say no more, sorr. As a man of honour there’s two
courses open to ye, and I leave ye to decide which of ’em ye’ll
take.</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>in great grief</i>). Matilda, did you hear that?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Yes, Tom, I heard that.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>furious</i>). Who is the scoundrel who has dared to
aspire to your hand?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> ’Deed, and I don’t know, but it’ll be some one who’s
lendin’ money to papa. I ginerally go with the bills.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>aghast</i>). What!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> When a body falls in love with me, papa ginerally
borrows money of him, and he gives bills, and I go with ’em.
It’s a rule of the family. (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> But surely you’ll never countenance such a bargain?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> ’Deed, and I don’t want to, Tom dear, but I’ve countenanced
it for thirteen years, and sure it ’ld look odd to refuse
now. Besides, dear, I’m not as young as I was.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> No, but then you’re not as old as you might be.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> No, but I’m as old as I mean to be. There’s razin for
ye, Tom, and ye want it.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Well, I’m sure I don’t know what to do; I’m at my
wits’ end.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Then it’s the beginning end, and there’s hope for ye
yet. (<i>Knock.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Who’s that?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> There, now, if it ain’t your friend Whipple’s carriage!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Whipple! Whipple with a carriage! A fool, an
impostor, a quack, with a carriage! What does he want to
come flaunting his one-horse fly in my face for? There, I
actually did that man’s botany papers for him at the College,
and now he’s rolling in fever patients,&mdash;literally <i>rolling</i> in fever
patients,&mdash;while I haven’t one to my back!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Well, maybe he’ll help ye if ye ask him. He’s a
pleasant man.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Pleasant, is he? I don’t know what you call pleasant.
Why, there’s a squalid old pauper idiot, a patient of his, who’s
got no name of his own, and Whipple christened him Tom
Cobb, because he says he’s the ugliest old lunatic he ever saw
and reminds him of me. And all the boys in the neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>hood
have taken it up, and he’s been known as Tom Cobb for
the last two years. That’s pleasant of Whipple.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Sure, it’s his joke.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Tom.</i> Yes, I know it’s his joke, but I don’t like his joke.
One Tom Cobb’s enough at a time, and&mdash;(<i>taking out pistol</i>)&mdash;if
I was only quite, quite sure I knew how to load it, I’d snuff
one of ’em out this minute. I would; upon my word and
honour, I would!</p>

me, and I like him too, and it’s a pity he ain’t rich. And now
who’s the gentleman with the command of ready money who’s
proposed for me, I’d like to know?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Miss Matilda, don’t think me premature for calling,
but I came because I really couldn’t wait any longer.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> And ye did right; sit ye down.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> I couldn’t help it; you’re not angry? (<i>Sits.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Not I! If ye couldn’t help it, what were ye to do?
(<i>Sits.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> I declare I haven’t slept a wink all night from anxiety.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Would ye like to take a snooze on the sofa?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> A snooze? Miss Matilda, hasn’t your father told you?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Told me&mdash;told me what?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Why, that I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Ye niver mean to sit there and tell me ye’re the young
gintleman of high family, unblemished morals, and considerable
command of ready money?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> That’s me&mdash;he <i>has</i> told you. Yes, Miss Matilda, I have
dared&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> But don’t ye know I’m engaged to your friend, Tom
Cobb?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Tom Cobb! Yes, I know you are. A mule, a clod,
an unsuccessful clod. Yes, I know he’s tied to you as a log is
tied to the leg of a runaway donkey. I beg your pardon&mdash;I
don’t mean that; but you can’t really love him?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> ’Deed, and I like him very well then. He’s a good boy.
But tell me now&mdash;is it bills?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> (<i>rather taken aback</i>). Well, yes; since you put it like
that, it <i>is</i> bills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Then I tell ye what, Mr. Whipple; I’m tired of being
handed over with stamped paper.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). There was <i>no</i> stamp on it; indeed, there
was no stamp on it. It was an I.O.U.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> It’s the same thing. I like Tom Cobb better than I
like you, and if he’ll marry me in a month I’ll have him, and if
he won’t, why I’ll talk to you. There’s your answer now, and
don’t bother again.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> In a month! (<i>Aside.</i>) In a month! He <i>shan’t</i>
marry her in a month! If I can only manage to get him out
of the way, and keep him there for a few weeks! (<i>Suddenly.</i>)
I’ll do it! It’ll cost money, but I’ll do it.</p>

<p>Ah! Tom, my boy, I’m delighted to see you; how uncommonly
jolly you’re looking, to be sure!</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>very miserably</i>). Yes, I should say I was looking uncommonly
jolly.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Why, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Why, a good many things; and look here, Whipple, I
wish next time you want a godfather for a nameless pauper
you’d choose somebody else.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Oh! you mean ugly old Tom Cobb! I beg your
pardon&mdash;but he was so like you I couldn’t help it. But there,
that needn’t distress you&mdash;for he died last night, and there’s an
end of him. Never mind, old boy, I’ll make it up to you some
day.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>suddenly</i>). Will you? Whipple, I’m in an awful fix
about Ben Isaacs’ bills; now you’re well off&mdash;I did your botany
paper for you at the College&mdash;will you lend me &pound;250 on my
personal security? I want a plain answer&mdash;yes or no.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> My dear boy, of course; with pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>delighted and surprised</i>). My dear Whipple!</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> You shall have it, of course. (<i>Feeling for his handkerchief.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> When?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Why, now, if you like.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> What&mdash;the money?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> No; the plain answer. (<i>Takes out handkerchief, uses
it, and returns it.</i>) I haven’t a penny at my bankers. I’ve lent
it all&mdash;to the colonel. What have you done with the money?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Well, <i>I</i> lent it all to&mdash;the Colonel. He borrowed it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
very day he agreed to my engagement with Matilda; didn’t he,
dear?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> (<i>clearing away breakfast things</i>). Just that very same
day, dear. Directly after I told him ye were going to propose
for me, and immediately before ye did it.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Good soldier, the Colonel.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, he didn’t borrow it because he wanted it; he borrowed
it to prevent my wasting it in foolishness. He said so;
but I <i>should</i> like to have a go in at some foolishness now and
then, if it was only a pair of trousers or half a dozen socks.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Yes, ye want socks.</p>

<p class="stage-dir-right">
[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Matilda</span> with breakfast things.</i>

<p><i>Tom.</i> But what’s the use of socks to a man who’s going to
blow his brains out? Whipple, I do assure you on my honour,
if I knew a safe and perfectly painless way of popping out of
this world into comfortable quarters in the next, I’d adopt it&mdash;upon
my word and honour, I’d adopt it!</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> (<i>suddenly</i>). Do you mean that?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, I mean that.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Then I’ll help you. Now, observe: my old pauper
patient, Tom Cobb, died last night. He hasn’t a friend or relation
in the world to claim him. Well, I certify to his death,
and he’s comfortably buried, and there’s an end of old Tom
Cobb.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> The ugly one?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> The ugly one, of course.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I don’t see what you’re driving at.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Don’t you? Why, if Tom Cobb’s dead and buried,
what becomes of the bill Tom Cobb gave Ben Isaacs?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> But the ugly Tom Cobb never gave a bill. (<i>A light
breaks upon him.</i>) Oh, you cunning devil!</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Now then, what d’ye say to dying by deputy?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> By Jove, it’s worth thinking of.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Worth thinking of? It’s worth jumping at without
stopping to think at all.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I believe you’re right. (<i>After a pause.</i>) I’ll do it!

<p><i>Car.</i> Yes; I came to town yesterday; and though ten long
weary years have flown since last we met, I could not pass my
dear old friend’s abode without one effort to awake those
slumbering chords that, struck in unison, ever found ready
echoes in our sister hearts.</p>

how lovely!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Yes, dear. Ye’re lookin’ older. Ye’re not married yet,
I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Alas, no! (<i>Wiping her eyes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Don’t fret, dear; it’ll come.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Oh, Matilda, a maiden’s heart should be as free as the
summer sun itself; and it’s sad when, in youth’s heyday, its
trilling gladness has been trodden underfoot by the iron-shod
heel of a serpent!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Yes; it’s sad when that’s happened. Tell me all
about it.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Swear that, come what may, no torture shall ever
induce you to reveal the secret I am going to confide to you?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Oh, I’ll swear that with pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Will you believe me when I tell you that&mdash;I have
loved?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Oh yes!</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> And that I have been loved in return?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Well, ye&mdash;es. Oh yes; it’s possible.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> He was a poet-soldier, fighting the Paynim foe in
India’s burning clime&mdash;a glorious songster, who swept the lute
with one hand, while he sabred the foe with the other!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Was he in the band?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> The band! He was a major-general! (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Oh! Handsome?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> I know not. I never saw him.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Ye never saw him?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> I never saw his face; but&mdash;I have seen his soul!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> What’s his soul like?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Like? Like the frenzied passion of the antelope!
Like the wild fire of the tiger-lily! Like the pale earnestness
of some lovesick thunder-cloud that longs to grasp the fleeting
lightning in his outstretched arms!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Was he often like that?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Always!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> A pleasant man in furnished lodgings! And where did
ye see his soul?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> (<i>sits</i>). He poured it into the columns of the <i>Weybridge
Watchman</i>, the local paper of the town that gave him birth.
Dainty little poems, the dew of his sweet soul, the tender
frothings of his soldier brain. In them I read him, and in
them I loved him! I wrote to him for his autograph&mdash;he sent
it. I sent him my photograph, and directly he saw it he proposed
in terms that cloyed me with the sweet surfeit of their
choice exuberance, imploring me at the same time to reply by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
telegraph. Then, maiden-like, I longed to toy and dally with
his love. But Anglo-Indian telegraphic rates are high; so, much
against my maiden will, I answered in one word&mdash;that one
word, yes!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> And ye’ve engaged yerself to a man whose face ye’ve
niver seen?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> I’ve seen his soul!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> And when d’ye think ye’ll see his body?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Alas, never! for (pity me) he is faithless! We corresponded
for a year, and then his letters ceased; and now, for
eighteen months, no crumb nor crust of comfort has appeased
my parched and thirsting soul! Fortunately my solicitor has
all his letters.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Oh, I see. And when does the action come off?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> I know not. We have advertised for him right and
left. Twenty men of law are on his track, and my brother
Bulstrode, an attorney’s clerk, carries a writ about him night
and day. Thus my heart-springs are laid bare that every
dolt may gibe at them&mdash;the whole county rings with my
mishap&mdash;its gloomy details are on every bumpkin’s tongue!
This&mdash;this is my secret. Swear that you will never reveal it!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Oh! but ye’ll get thumping damages when ye <i>do</i> find
him.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> It may be so. The huckstering men of law appraise
my heart-wreck at five thousand pounds!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Well, and I wish ye may get it, dear!</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Thank you, oh! thank you for that wish.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Ye’re not goin’?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> No; I have come to spend a long, long day. I’m going
to take my bonnet off. (<i>Solemnly.</i>) Dear Matilda, we have
not met for many many years, and I long&mdash;I cannot tell you,
Matilda, how earnestly I long&mdash;to see all your new things!</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> (<i>looking at her sternly</i>). Matilda, are ye in earnest, or

<p><i>Mat.</i> Oh! I’m in earnest. Tom’s dead.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Who’s killed him?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Faith, an’ he killed himself. He’s written to say so.
Here’s his letter. He encloses yer two bills and app’ints ye his
executor.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Ye pain and surproise me more than I can tell ye.
Poor Tom! He was a koind and ginerous lad, and I’d hoped
to have met these bills under happier circumstances. Well, his
executor deals with them now&mdash;that’s me; and the question
is whether, in the interests of Tom’s estate, it would be worth
while to proceed against the acceptor&mdash;that’s me again; and, on
the whole, I don’t recommend it. (<i>Tears them up.</i>) Now, tell
me all about it; don’t cry, my child.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> No, pa. Well, it’s loike this&mdash;Ben Isaacs was overpressin’,
and poor Tom was bothered, and thought he’d make
an end of himself; and just then he heard that the ould man,
that Whipple called Tom Cobb from the loikeness, had just
died. So Tom thought he’d make one death do for the two.
Sure, he’s been economically brought up.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> What! Am I to onderstand that Thomas Cobb has
been troiflin’ with the most sacred feelings of an old soldier’s
grey-headed ould harr’t?</p>

Let me come across him, and by the blood of the O’Fipps, I’ll
make him sham dead in rale earnest!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> But, papa dear, the boy’s hard pressed!</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Don’t interrupt an honest burst of feelin’ in an old
military officer. For months I’ve looked forward like a simple
ould soldier to meetin’ those bills, and now I’ve destroyed them,
and deproived meself of a pleasure which might have lasted me
the next twenty years! But I’ll expose him. It’s a croime of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>

and maybe it’ll be the last. (<i>Laughing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> (<i>furious</i>). Mentioned in a will! It’s an outrage&mdash;a
sacrilege, I tell ye&mdash;an insult to a simple ould officer and his
deluded gyurl, to mention them in a swindlin’ document that’s
not worth the ink it’s written with! This is how I treat it,

<p><i>Whi.</i> My darling Matilda, who was it who said the course
of true love never did run smooth? Are not our loves true?
And could anything be smoother than their course during the
last three months?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> No, dear, savin’ that when ye proposed for me, papa
kicked ye out of the house.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> He did, in the effusion of the moment, and I honour
him for it! On his unexpected accession to wealth he naturally
looked for a wealthy and well-born son-in-law, and I honour
him for it! But the doughty old soldier was open to reason,
and when I proved to him that his wealth depended on my
secrecy, he admitted his error at once, like a frank old warrior
as he is, and I honour him for it!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Poor Tom! I wonder what’s come of him all this
while? It’s three months since he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Died.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Died, and I’ve never heard a word from him since.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Then he can’t complain if you’ve been inconstant.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> ’Deed, and he can’t. It’s clear a young girl must marry
somebody. It’s nature.</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">O’Fipp</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Of course it is, and if he truly loves you&mdash;really and
truly loves you as I do, he ought to be delighted when he
comes back to find that you’ve engaged yourself to a gentleman
in every way his superior.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Won’t come back any more?</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Not he. Isn’t he dead, and haven’t we buried him,
and paid his debts, and proved his will, and stuck up a tombstone
that he’d blush to read. Sure, it’ll be in the highest
degree ondacent in him to give the lie to a tombstone!</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> But Tom never had any tact&mdash;and if he <i>should</i> be
guilty of the indiscretion of turning up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>O’Fi.</i> Well, sorr, if he should, I shall be prepared to admit
that I’ve acted under a misconception. But, sorr, before I yield
possession of the estate which has so miraculously come into
my hands, I shall satisfy meself beyond all doubt that I am not
dealin’ with an imposthor. Any one who assumes to be the
late Tom Cobb will have to establish his identity beyond all
manner of doubt. And as I’ve paid Mr. Ben Isaacs and his
other creditors conditionally on his being dead, he may find
that difficult, sorr,&mdash;he may find that difficult.</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">O’Fipp.</span></i></p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Well, Tom Cobb may be dead, but when he finds out
the use that’s been made of his will, he’ll not rest in his grave,
I’m thinking, that’s all!</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> But if he <i>should</i> return&mdash;if Tom Cobb’s shade <i>should</i>
take it into his ghostly head to revisit the scenes of his earthly
happiness&mdash;promise me that you will treat him with the cold
respect due to a disembodied spirit.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> But when d’ye think he’ll come?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Well, between ourselves, I think we may look for his
apparition at an early date. Unless the necessaries of life are
considerably cheaper in the other world than in this, Tom Cobb’s
five and twenty pounds must be as shadowy as himself by this
time.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> But if he comes to life, who’s to kill him again?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Oh, your papa will have to kill him; it’s his turn.

<p><i>Mat.</i> And a doctor’s, too.</p>

Cobb, 6,” in red cotton (<i>showing mark on pocket-handkerchief</i>),

about me, which I shall be happy to show you at a more convenient

<p><i>Tom.</i> Colonel O’Fipp, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Stop, sorr. If this conversation is to continue, I must
be informed whom I have the pleasure of addressing. Up to
the present moment we have only learnt who you are <i>not</i>. Let
us now proceed to ascertain who ye <i>are</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Colonel, I’m in that state of mental confusion, that
I declare I don’t know who I am. Give me a little breathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
time. When a young man believes he’s been Tom Cobb for
twenty-five years, and then suddenly finds himself kicked out
of Tom Cobb, with nowhere to go to, he <i>wants</i> a little breathing
time to look about him and find a name to let.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Well, sorr, for the purpose of this interview one name’s
as good as another. Here’s the <i>Toimes</i> newspaper. Ye’ll find
many a good name goin’ beggin’ in that. Choose yer name.
Here’s a gintleman who was hanged this mornin’! Would ye
like <i>his</i> name? He’s done with it.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Don’t be unpleasant, Colonel.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Well, put your finger down; take the first that comes.
(<i>Puts <span class="smcap">Cobb’s</span> finger on the newspaper at random.</i>) Here’s one&mdash;the
Bishop of Bath and Wells.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Nonsense! Who’d take me for a bishop?</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Then try again. Mr. and Mrs. German Reed.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Don’t be absurd.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Well, once more. Major-Gineral Arthur Fitzpatrick.
What d’ye say to that?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> But I don’t look like a major-general.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Well, sorr, and what of that? I don’t look like a
lieutenant-colonel, do I?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> No, you don’t; but a major-general in broken boots!</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Sure it’s where yer corns have been shootin’ through.
Ye wouldn’t have a major-gineral with corns that couldn’t
shoot, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> No!</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Now, sorr, it’ll take a mighty deal of argument to pursuade
me that you’re not Major-Gineral Arthur Fitzpatrick in
broken boots. Now, I’ve the credit of the surrvice at stake, and
when I see a major-gineral in broken boots me harrut bleeds for
him, and I long to allow him a pound a week, sorr&mdash;a pound a
week&mdash;to keep up his military position.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> A pound a week?</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> No less, sorr. Now, as long as Major-Gineral Arthur
Fitzpatrick chooses to claim a pound a week of me, it’s here at
his service. But on the onderstanding that he resumes his
name and rank, and ceases for ever the dishonourable and
unsoldierlike practice of masquerading under a false name.
D’ye onderstand me, sorr?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes&mdash;I understand you.</p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Do ye agree?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I’m so hungry, and seedy, and wretched, that I’d agree
to anything. You couldn’t oblige me with the first week in
advance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p><i>O’Fi.</i> Sorr, it has always been Terence O’Fipp’s maxim to
pay everything in advance. I’ll go and get ye a pound, and
ye can amuse yeself by writing out the receipt while I’m gone.
(<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> (<i>sitting down to write</i>). Colonel, I don’t know whether
to be very much obliged to you, or to look upon you as the

<p><i>Mrs. Eff.</i> Adolphus, what a sweet spot! A rural paradise,
indeed. How balmy, and yet how cheap!</p>

<p><i>Eff.</i> I am an old, old man, and I have learnt the hollowness
of outward splendours. The house is, indeed, well enough, and
(it may be) cheap&mdash;but, after all, what <i>is</i> the house?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> (<i>politely.</i>) Seventy-five pounds a year, on a three
years’ agreement, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Eff.</i> (<i>not heeding him.</i>) After all, what <i>is</i> the house but the
outer husk? Let us rather learn to value the fruit within.
The shell, truly, is goodly; but where, oh, where is the kernel?</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>politely</i>). He will be here in one minute. (<i>All turn

such a paradise opens a new vista of Life’s Possibilities.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Well, I really don’t know; I haven’t anything just now.</p>

honey for our little hives.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>with a desperate effort to be brilliant</i>). Talking of bees
(<i>all take out note-books and write down what follows</i>)&mdash;talking
of bees, have you ever remarked how the busy little insect avails
herself of the sunshine to gather her sweet harvest from&mdash;from
every opening flower?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Eff.</i> (<i>writing</i>). We have, we have. How true to fact!</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> (<i>writing</i>). You said “her sweet harvest,” I think?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Her sweet harvest.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> (<i>writing</i>). Her sweet harvest. (<i>All shake their heads
and sigh.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Her honey, you know.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> Thank you. (<i>Sighs. All finish writing and put up
their note-books.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Eff.</i> You are a close student of nature, sir.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, I do a good deal in that way.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Eff.</i> How simple are his words, and yet what priceless
pearls of thought lie encased beneath their outer crust!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, I always wrap them in an outer crust, to keep
them from the cold. (<i>All take out note-books and write this
down.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> (<i>writing</i>).</p>

<div class="verse04">“He wraps them in an outer crust</div>

<p>And once I sneered at these grand utterances, just as we continually
sneer at shapeless clods upon the road, which, on inspection,
turn out to be jewelled bracelets of exceeding price!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Nothing more common. It’s the old story. The superficial
mind (<i>all take out books and write</i>)&mdash;the superficial
mind looks for cream upon the surface of the milk; but the
profound philosopher dives down deep below. (<i>Aside.</i>) Much
more of this and my mind will give way!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Eff.</i> You are a deep thinker, sir. I can fancy Shakespeare
to have been such another.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Shakespeare? Shakespeare never said anything like
that! How&mdash;how do you do it?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I don’t know. It comes. I shut my eyes and it comes.
(<i>All shut their eyes and try.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> I cannot do it. Ah me! I shall never learn to talk
like that.</p>

<p><i>Bul.</i> No, it might not be. I am fated. Destiny has declared
against me. Fettered to the desk of an obscure attorney&mdash;forced
to imprison my soaring soul within the left-off garments
of a father whose figure has but little in common with
my own, who can wonder that my life is one protracted misfit?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Eff.</i> (<i>rising</i>). My boy, sneer not at those clothes. They
have been worn for many, many years by a very old, but very
upright man. Be proud of them. No sordid thought has ever
lurked behind that waistcoat. That hat has never yet been
doffed to vicious wealth. Those shoes have never yet walked
into the parlours of the sinful.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Eff.</i> (<i>embracing him</i>). I am sure of that, Adolphus,&mdash;I
am very, very sure of that.</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Bul.</i> It may be as you say. I <i>do</i> respect these clothes, but
not even a father’s eloquence can gloze over the damning fact
that they are second-hand!</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> A blessing on him. Is he not benevolent?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, he looks so. Why do benevolent people have
such long hair? Do they say to themselves, “I am a benevolent
person, so I will let my hair grow,” or do they let it grow
because they are too benevolent to cut it off?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> There are thousands of such questions that appear at
every turn to make us marvel at Nature’s strange decrees.
Let us not pry into these dark secrets. Let us rather enquire
whether you have any chance of getting anything to do?
(<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> No; there’s no opening for major-generals just now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p><i>Car.</i> And yet how nobly you would lead your troops into
action, caracolling at their head on a proud Arabian barb, and
rousing them to very frenzy by shouting forth martial songs of
your own composition! Oh! it would madden them!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, I think it would! But at present I’ve only my
half-pay&mdash;a pound a week&mdash;and we can’t marry on that.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Why not? It is ten shillings a week each. I am content
if you are. Say, Arthur, shall we be made one?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> My dear Caroline, it’s nonsense to talk about being
made one. (<i>She takes out her note-book.</i>) It’s my experience
that when poor people marry, they’re made half a dozen, at

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Car.</i> Arthur! (<i>Shuts up book.</i>) Well, I must wait and hope.
Oh for a war! (<i><span class="smcap">Cobb</span> much alarmed.</i>) A vast, vast, vast war!

his path where’er the fight is thickest! Oh! I think I see

<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Caroline</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes. I think I see myself doing it! Poor, dear girl,
it’s a shame to deceive her, but what can I do in the face of
this confounded advertisement, which still appears in all the
papers every day! (<i>Reads.</i>) “&pound;50 reward will be paid to any
one who will give any information concerning the whereabouts
of Thomas Cobb, M.R.C.S. Apply to Docket and Tape, 27,
Paragon, Somers Town!” For just six mouths this blighting
paragraph has appeared in every paper in London. Every one
is talking about it; a Christmas annual has been published,
“How we found Tom Cobb,” and a farce, called “Tom Cobb
found at last,” is playing at a principal theatre!</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Whipple</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Whipple, you here?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Yes, how de do? I’m quite well. So’s Matilda.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> That name!</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> She’s downstairs, with Miss Effingham.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Downstairs! And does she&mdash;don’t think I ask from
an improper motive&mdash;does she ever talk about me? (<i>Sits.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Never mentions you by any chance. But she often
drops a tear to the memory of poor dead-and-gone Tom Cobb.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh! she does <i>that</i>, does she? That’s rather nasty for
you, isn’t it?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Not a bit. (<i>Sits.</i>) It does her credit, and I honour her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
for it. The poor fellow’s dead, and there’s an end to him. I
loved him as a brother! (<i>Wiping his eye.</i>) He did my botany
papers for me at the College. But it’s no use repining. No
power on earth can bring him to life again, now. How she
loved that man!</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>half sobbing</i>). Oh, Matilda! Be good to her, Whipple.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> I will, General; trust me.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Is she&mdash;is she as fond of the theatre as ever!</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Quite. We go every night.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> She used to call it the “theayter.”</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> (<i>much moved</i>). She does still!</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Bless her for it. And does she still like oysters after
the play?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Always. She bargains for ’em&mdash;stout and oysters.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> She used to call them “histers.”</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> She does still.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, thank you for this news of her. Oh, Whipple,
make that woman happy!</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Trust me&mdash;I will, for poor dear Tom Cobb’s sake.
How she loved that man! (<i>Wipes his eye.</i>) But this is not
business. The Colonel, who is downstairs with Mr. Effingham,
begged me to give you this&mdash;your weekly screw. Allow me,
Major-General. (<i>Gives him a sovereign.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Thank you. The Colonel is always regular and punctual
with my little pension.</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> The Colonel is extremely punctilious about money
matters. Oh, I quite forgot&mdash;he further desires me to say that
from this moment he proposes to discontinue your weekly payment.</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>aghast</i>). What!</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> From this moment your little pension dries up.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Do you mean to tell me that he intends deliberately to
break his plighted word?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> That is precisely what I intended to convey.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> And cut off my only source of sustenance?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Absolutely.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> But hang it, man, don’t he know that his liberty and
wealth are at my mercy?</p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Yes, he knows that; but he’s prepared to risk it. You
see, General, Messrs. Docket and Tape are looking out for Tom
Cobb. Tom Cobb’s wanted. I don’t know what he’s done, but
people talk about a forged will. He’s advertised for every day.
You may have noticed it.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Yes, I’ve remarked it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p><i>Whi.</i> Well, if Tom Cobb is alive this advertisement is quite
enough to keep him quiet. The Colonel, having this fact
strongly before his eyes, considers that as he has no further
interest in Major-General Fitzpatrick’s existence, he does not
see why he should be called upon to contribute to his support.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> But it’s ruin! Hang it&mdash;it’s starvation! Whipple,
you used to be a nice man once&mdash;ask him to see me&mdash;ask him
to speak to me for five minutes! By your old niceness, I
implore you!</p>

<p class="pre-exit"><i>Whi.</i> I can’t resist that appeal! I’ll ask him, but I’m not
sanguine. You see, he’s been in the constant practice of breaking
his promise for the last sixty-five years, and it’s degenerated
into a habit.</p>
<p class="go-out">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Whipple</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> And I did that man’s&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Furious.</i>) But I’ll be even

a desperate man. My mind’s made up. I’ll write to Docket and
Tape, and tell the whole truth! (<i>Sits down to write.</i>) Now,
Colonel O’Fipp, tremble, and you, Whipple, tremble, and Matilda.
(<i>Throws down pen.</i>) I would spare Matilda! But no, let <i>her</i>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Good day, reverend sir.</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> Ah, good Mrs. Partlet, I am glad to see you. And
your little daughter, Constance! Why, she is quite a little
woman, I declare!</p>

<p><i>Con.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Oh, mother, I cannot speak to him!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Yes, reverend sir, she is nearly eighteen, and as good
a girl as ever stepped. (<i>Aside to <span class="smcap">Dr. D.</span></i>) Ah, sir, I’m afraid
I shall soon lose her!</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> (<i>aside to <span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span></i>). Dear me! you pain me very much.
Is she delicate?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Oh no, sir; I don’t mean that; but young girls look
to get married.</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> Oh, I take you. To be sure. But there’s plenty of
time for that. Four or five years hence, Mrs. Partlet, four or
five years hence. But when the time <i>does</i> come, I shall have
much pleasure in marrying her myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> I have often wondered, reverend sir (if you’ll excuse
the liberty), that <i>you</i> have never married.</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Be still, my fluttering heart!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> A clergyman’s wife does so much good in a village.
Besides that, you are not so young as you were, and before very
long you will want somebody to nurse you, and look after your
little comforts.</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> Mrs. Partlet, there is much truth in what you say. I
am indeed getting on in years, and a helpmate would cheer
my declining days. Time was when it might have been; but
I have left it too long. I am an old fogey now, am I not, my
dear? (<i>to <span class="smcap">Constance</span></i>)&mdash;a very old fogey, indeed. Ha! ha! No,
Mrs. Partlet, my mind is quite made up. I shall live and die a

<p><i>Sir M.</i> Yes, you are a fortunate young fellow, and I will not
disguise from you that this union with the house of Sangazure
realizes my fondest wishes. Aline is rich, and she comes of a
sufficiently old family, for she is the seven thousand and thirty-seventh
in direct descent from Helen of Troy. True, there was
a blot on the escutcheon of that lady&mdash;that affair with Paris&mdash;but
where is the family, other than my own, in which there is
no flaw? You are a lucky fellow, sir&mdash;a very lucky fellow!</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Father, I am welling over with limpid joy! No
sicklying taint of sorrow overlies the lucid lake of liquid love,
upon which, hand in hand, Aline and I are to float into
eternity!</p>

<p><i>Sir M.</i> Alexis, I desire that of your love for this young lady
you do not speak so openly. You are always singing ballads in
praise of her beauty, and you expect the very menials who wait
behind your chair to chorus your ecstasies. It is not delicate.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Father, a man who loves as I love&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir M.</i> Pooh, pooh, sir! fifty years ago I madly loved your
future mother-in-law, the Lady Sangazure, and I have reason
to believe that she returned my love. But were we guilty of
the indelicacy of publicly rushing into each other’s arms, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> At last we are alone! My darling, you are now irrevocably
betrothed to me. Are you not very, very happy?</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Oh, Alexis, can you doubt it? Do I not love you beyond
all on earth, and am I not beloved in return? Is not
true love, faithfully given and faithfully returned, the source of
every earthly joy?</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Of that there can be no doubt. Oh that the world
could be persuaded of the truth of that maxim! Oh that the
world would break down the artificial barriers of rank, wealth,
education, age, beauty, habits, taste, and temper, and recognize
the glorious principle, that in marriage alone is to be found the
panacea for every ill!</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Continue to preach that sweet doctrine, and you will
succeed, oh, evangel of true happiness!</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> I hope so, but as yet the cause progresses but slowly.
Still I have made some converts to the principle, that men and
women should be coupled in matrimony without distinction of
rank. I have lectured on the subject at Mechanics’ Institutes,
and the mechanics were unanimous in favour of my views. I
have preached in workhouses, beershops, and lunatic asylums,
and I have been received with enthusiasm. I have addressed
navvies on the advantages that would accrue to them if they
married wealthy ladies of rank, and not a navvy dissented.</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Noble fellows! And yet there are those who hold that
the uneducated classes are not open to argument! And what
do the countesses say?</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Why, at present, it can’t be denied, the aristocracy hold
aloof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> The working man is the true Intelligence, after all!</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> He is a noble creature when he is quite sober. Yes,
Aline, true happiness comes of true love, and true love should
be independent of external influences. It should live upon itself
and by itself&mdash;in itself love should live for love alone!</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Oh, Alexis, those are noble principles!</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Yes, Aline, and I am going to take a desperate step in
support of them. Have you ever heard of the firm of J. W.
Wells and Co., the old-established family sorcerers, in St. Mary
Axe?</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> I have seen their advertisement.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> They have invented a philtre, which, if report may be
believed, is simply infallible. I intend to distribute it through
the village, and within half an hour of my doing so, there will
not be an adult in the place who will not have learnt the secret
of pure and lasting happiness. What do you say to that?</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Well, dear, of course a filter is a very useful thing in
a house; quite indispensable in the present state of Thames
water; but still I don’t quite see that it is the sort of thing
that places its possessor on the very pinnacle of earthly joy.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Aline, you misunderstand me. I didn’t say a filter&mdash;I
said philtre.</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> So did I, dear. <i>I</i> said a filter.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> No, dear, you said a filter. I don’t mean a filter&mdash;I
mean a philtre,&mdash;ph, you know.</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). You don’t mean a love-potion?</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> On the contrary&mdash;I <i>do</i> mean a love-potion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Oh, Alexis, I don’t think it would be right. I don’t
indeed. And then&mdash;a real magician! Oh, it would be downright
wicked.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Aline, is it, or is it not, a laudable object to steep the
whole village up to its lips in love, and to couple them in matrimony,
without distinction of age, rank, or fortune?</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Unquestionably, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Then, unpleasant as it must be to have recourse to
supernatural aid, I must nevertheless pocket my aversion, in
deference to the great and good end I have in view. (<i>Calling.</i>)
Hercules!</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Is Mr. Wells there?</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> I trust my Aline will not yield to fear while the strong
right arm of her Alexis is here to protect her.</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> It’s nonsense, dear, to talk of your protecting me with
your strong right arm, in face of the fact that this Family
Sorcerer could change me into a guinea-pig before you could
turn round.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> He <i>could</i> change you into a guinea-pig, no doubt, but
it is most unlikely that he would take such liberty. It’s a most
respectable firm, and I am sure he would never be guilty of so
untradesmanlike an act.</p>

nativity at a low figure, and we have a horoscope at three and
six that we can guarantee. Our Abudah chests, each containing
a patent hag who comes out and prophesies disasters, with
spring complete, are strongly recommended. Our Aladdin
lamps are very chaste, and our prophetic tablets, foretelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
everything&mdash;from a change of ministry down to a rise in
Turkish stock&mdash;are much inquired for. Our penny curse&mdash;one
of the cheapest things in the trade&mdash;is considered infallible.
We have some very superior blessings, too, but they’re very
little asked for. We’ve only sold one since Christmas&mdash;to a
gentleman who bought it to send to his mother-in-law&mdash;but it
turned out that he was afflicted in the head, and it’s been
returned on our hands. But our sale of penny curses, especially
on Saturday nights, is tremendous. We can’t turn ’em out fast
enough.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> I have sent for you to consult you on a very important
matter. I believe you advertise a Patent Oxy-Hydrogen Love-at-first-sight
Philtre?</p>

<p><i>Mr. W.</i> Sir, it is our leading article. (<i>Producing a phial.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Now, I want to know if you can confidently guarantee
it as possessing all the qualities you claim for it in your advertisement?</p>

<p><i>Mr. W.</i> Sir, we are not in the habit of puffing our goods.
Ours is an old-established house with a large family connection,
and every assurance held out in the advertisement is fully
realized. (<i>Hurt.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Oh, Alexis, don’t offend him! He’ll change us
into something dreadful&mdash;I know he will!</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> I am anxious from purely philanthropical motives to
distribute this philtre, secretly, among the inhabitants of this
village. I shall of course require a quantity. How do you
sell it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. W.</i> In buying a quantity, sir, we should strongly advise
your taking it in the wood, and drawing it off as you happen to
want it. We have it in four and a half and nine gallon casks&mdash;also
in pipes and hogsheads for laying down, and we deduct
10 per cent. for prompt cash.</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Oh, Alexis, surely you don’t want to lay any down!</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Aline, the villagers will assemble to carouse in a few
minutes. Go and fetch the teapot.</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> But, Alexis&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> My dear, you must obey me, if you please. Go and

<p><i>Mr. W.</i> In half an hour. Whoever drinks of it falls in love,
as a matter of course, with the first lady he meets who has also
tasted it, and his affection is at once returned. One trial will
prove the fact.</p>

affect the whole village.</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> But bless me, Alexis, many of the villagers are married
people.</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> (<i>musing</i>). It is singular&mdash;it is very singular. It has
overthrown all my calculations. It is distinctly opposed to the
doctrine of averages. I cannot understand it.</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Dear Dr. Daly, what has puzzled you?</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> My dear, this village has not hitherto been addicted
to marrying and giving in marriage. Hitherto the youths of
this village have not been enterprising, and the maidens have
been distinctly coy. Judge then of my surprise when I tell
you that the whole village came to me in a body just now, and
implored me to join them in matrimony with as little delay as
possible. Even your excellent father has hinted to me that
before very long it is not unlikely that he, also, may change
his condition.</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Oh, Alexis&mdash;do you hear that? Are you not delighted?</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> Yes. I confess that a union between your mother and
my father would be a happy circumstance indeed. (<i>Crossing to
<span class="smcap">Dr. Daly</span>.</i>) My dear sir, the news that you bring us is very
gratifying.</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> Yes&mdash;still, in my eyes, it has its melancholy side.
This universal marrying recalls the happy days&mdash;now, alas!
gone for ever&mdash;when I myself might have&mdash;but tush! I am
puling. I am too old to marry&mdash;and yet, within the last half-hour,
I have greatly yearned for companionship. I never remarked
it before, but the young maidens of this village are
very comely. So likewise are the middle-aged. Also the
elderly. All are comely&mdash;and (<i>with a deep sigh</i>) all are engaged!</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Here comes your father.</p>

<p class="stage-dir"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Sir Marmaduke</span> with <span class="smcap">Mrs. Partlet</span>, arm-in-arm.</i></p>

<p><i>Ali. and Alex.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Mrs. Partlet!</p>

<p><i>Sir M.</i> Dr. Daly, give me joy. Alexis, my dear boy, you
will, I am sure, be pleased to hear that my declining days are
not unlikely to be solaced by the companionship of this good,
virtuous, and amiable woman.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> (<i>rather taken aback</i>). My dear father, this is not altogether
what I expected. I am certainly taken somewhat by
surprise. Still it can hardly be necessary to assure you that
any wife of yours is a mother of mine. (<i>Aside to <span class="smcap">Aline</span>.</i>) It
is not quite what I could have wished.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> (<i>crossing to <span class="smcap">Alexis</span></i>). Oh, sir, I entreat your forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span>ness.
I am aware that socially I am not everything that could
be desired, nor am I blessed with an abundance of worldly
goods, but I can at least confer on your estimable father the
great and priceless dowry of a true, tender, and loving heart.</p>

<p><i>Alex.</i> (<i>coldly</i>). I do not question it. After all, a faithful
love is the true source of every earthly joy.</p>

<p><i>Sir M.</i> I knew that my boy would not blame his poor father
for acting on the impulse of a heart that has never yet misled
him. Zorah is not, perhaps, what the world call beautiful&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> Still she is comely&mdash;distinctly comely! (<i>Sighs.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ali.</i> Zorah is very good, and very clean and honest, and
quite sober in her habits; and that is worth far more than
beauty, dear Sir Marmaduke.</p>

<p><i>Dr. D.</i> Yes; beauty will fade and perish, but personal
cleanliness is practically undying, for it can be renewed whenever
it discovers symptoms of decay. My dear Sir Marmaduke,
I heartily congratulate you. (<i>Sighs.</i>)</p>

the heart I would not coerce my daughter&mdash;I attach but little
value to rank or wealth, but the line must be drawn somewhere.
A man in that station may be brave and worthy, but
at every step he would commit solecisms that society would
never pardon.</p>

<p><i>Jos.</i> Oh, I have thought of this night and day. But fear
not, father. I have a heart, and therefore I love; but I am your
daughter, and therefore I am proud. Though I carry my love
with me to the tomb, he shall never, never know it.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> You <i>are</i> my daughter, after all. But see, Sir Joseph’s
barge approaches, manned by twelve trusty oarsmen and
accompanied by the admiring crowd of female relatives that
attend him wherever he goes. Retire, my daughter, to your
cabin&mdash;take this, his photograph, with you&mdash;it may help to
bring you to a more reasonable frame of mind.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> You’ve a remarkably fine crew, Captain Corcoran.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> It <i>is</i> a fine crew, Sir Joseph.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> (<i>examining a very small midshipman</i>). A British
sailor is a splendid fellow, Captain Corcoran.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> A splendid fellow indeed, Sir Joseph.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> I hope you treat your crew kindly, Captain Corcoran.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Indeed, I hope so, Sir Joseph.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> Never forget that they are the bulwarks of England’s
greatness, Captain Corcoran.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> So I have always considered them, Sir Joseph.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> What percentage of words are spelled phonetically?
No bullying, I trust&mdash;no strong language of any
kind, eh?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Oh, never, Sir Joseph.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> What, <i>never</i>?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Hardly ever, Sir Joseph. They are an excellent crew,
and do their work thoroughly without it.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> (<i>reproving</i>). Don’t patronize them, sir&mdash;pray, don’t
patronize them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Certainly not, Sir Joseph.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> That you are their captain is an accident of birth. I
cannot permit these noble fellows to be patronized because an
accident of birth has placed you above them and them below
you.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> I am the last person to insult a British sailor, Sir
Joseph.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> You are the last person who did, Captain Corcoran.
Desire that splendid seaman to step forward.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Ralph Rackstraw, come here.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> (<i>sternly</i>). If what?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> I beg your pardon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> You’re a remarkably fine fellow.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Yes, your honour.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> And a first-rate seaman, I’ll be bound.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> There’s not a smarter topman in the navy, your
honour, though I say it who shouldn’t.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> Not at all. Proper self-respect, nothing more. Can
you dance a hornpipe?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> No, your honour.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> That’s a pity: all sailors should dance hornpipes. I
will teach you one this evening, after dinner. Now, tell me&mdash;don’t
be afraid&mdash;how does your captain treat you, eh?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> A better captain don’t walk the deck, your honour.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Hear!</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> Good. I like to hear you speak well of your commanding
officer; I dare say he don’t deserve it, but still it does
you credit. Can you sing?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> I can hum a little, your honour.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> Then hum this at your leisure. (<i>Giving him MS.
music.</i>) It is a song that I have composed for the use of the
Royal Navy. It is designed to encourage independence of
thought and action in the lower branches of the service, and
to teach the principle that a British sailor is any man’s equal,
excepting mine. Now, Captain Corcoran, a word with you in
your cabin, on a tender and sentimental subject.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> Ay, ay, Sir Joseph. Boatswain, in commemoration of
this joyous occupation, see that extra grog is served out to the
ship’s company at one bell.</p>

<p><i>Boat.</i> Beg pardon. If what, your honour?</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> If what? I don’t think I understand you.</p>

<p><i>Boat.</i> If you <i>please</i>, your honour.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> I can hardly say; but she is a modest girl, and her
social position is far below your own. It may be that she feels
she is not worthy of you.</p>

<p><i>Sir J.</i> That is really a very sensible suggestion, and displays
more knowledge of human nature than I had given you credit
for.</p>

<p><i>Capt.</i> See, she comes. If your lordship would kindly reason
with her, and assure her, officially, that it is a standing rule at
the Admiralty that love levels all ranks, her respect for an

a handspike.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Yes, I have done my best for you. And why? It
was my duty under my indentures, and I am the slave of duty.
As a child I was regularly apprenticed to your band. It was

<div class="verse">When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and daring,</div>
<div class="verse">His father thought he’d ’prentice him to some career seafaring.</div>
<div class="verse">I was, alas, his nursery-maid, and so it fell to <i>my</i> lot</div>
<div class="verse">To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a <i>pilot</i>&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">A life not bad for a hardy lad, though certainly not a high lot.</div>
<div class="verse">Though I’m a nurse, you might do worse than make your boy a pilot.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I was a stupid nursery-maid, on breakers always steering,</div>
<div class="verse">And I did not catch the word aright, through being hard of hearing;</div>
<div class="verse">Mistaking my instructions, which within my brain did gyrate,</div>
<div class="verse">I took and bound this promising boy apprentice to a <i>pirate</i>.</div>
<div class="verse">A sad mistake it was to make and doom him to a vile lot.</div>
<div class="verse">I bound him to a pirate&mdash;you&mdash;instead of to a pilot.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I soon found out, beyond all doubt, the scope of this disaster,</div>
<div class="verse">But I hadn’t the face to return to my place, and break it to my master.</div>
<div class="verse">A nursery-maid is never afraid of what you people <i>call</i> work,</div>
<div class="verse">So I made up my mind to go as a kind of piratical maid of all work;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span>
<div class="verse">And that is how you find me now a member of your shy lot,</div>
<div class="verse">Which you wouldn’t have found, had he been bound apprentice to a pilot.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(<i>Kneeling at his feet.</i>) Oh, pardon! Frederic, pardon!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Rise, sweet one; I have long pardoned you.</p>

<p><i>Ruth</i> (<i>rises</i>). The two words were so much alike.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> They were. They still are, though years have rolled
over their heads. (<i><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> goes up with <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>.</i>) But this
afternoon my obligation ceases. Individually I love you all
with affection unspeakable, but collectively, I look upon you
with a disgust that amounts to absolute detestation. Oh! pity
me, my beloved friend, for such is my sense of duty, that once
out of my indentures I shall feel myself bound to devote
myself heart and soul to your extermination!</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Poor lad! poor lad! (<i>All weep.</i>)</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Well, Frederic, if you conscientiously feel that it is
your duty to destroy us, we cannot blame you for acting on
that conviction. Always act in accordance with the dictates
of your conscience, my boy, and chance the consequences.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Besides, we can offer you but little temptation to
remain with us. We don’t seem to make piracy pay. I’m
sure I don’t know why, but we don’t.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> <i>I</i> know why, but, alas! I mustn’t tell you; it wouldn’t
be right.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Why not, my boy? It’s only half-past eleven, and
you are one of us until the clock strikes twelve.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> True, and until then you are bound to protect our
interests.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Hear, hear!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Well, then, it is my duty, as a pirate, to tell you that
you are too tender-hearted. For instance, you make a point of
never attacking a weaker party than yourselves, and when you
attack a stronger party, you invariably get thrashed.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> There is some truth in that.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Then, again, you make a point of never molesting an
orphan!</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Of course: we are orphans ourselves, and know what
it is.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Yes, but it has got about, and what is the consequence?
Every one we capture says he’s an orphan. The
last three ships we took proved to be manned entirely by
orphans, and so we had to let them go. One would think that
Great Britain’s mercantile navy was recruited solely from her
orphan asylums&mdash;which we know is not the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> But, hang it all, you wouldn’t have us absolutely
merciless?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> There’s my difficulty; until twelve o’clock I would,
after twelve I wouldn’t. Was ever a man placed in so delicate
a situation!</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> And Ruth, your own Ruth, whom you love so well,
and who has won her middle-aged way into your boyish heart,
what is to become of <i>her</i>?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Oh, he will take you with him.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Well, Ruth, I feel some little difficulty about you.
It is true that I admire you very much, but I have been
constantly at sea since I was eight years old, and yours is the
only woman’s face I have seen during that time. I think it is
a sweet face!</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> It is, oh, it is!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I say I <i>think</i> it is; that is my impression. But as I
have never had an opportunity of comparing you with other
women, it is just possible I may be mistaken.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> True.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> What a terrible thing it would be if I were to marry
this innocent person, and then find out that she is, on the
whole, plain!</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Oh, Ruth is very well, very well indeed.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Yes, there are the remains of a fine woman about Ruth.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Do you really think so? Then I will not be so
selfish as to take her from you. In justice to her, and in consideration
for you, I will leave her behind. (<i>Hands <span class="smcap">Ruth</span> to
<span class="smcap">King</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>King.</i> No, Frederic, this must not be. We are rough men,
who lead a rough life, but we are not so utterly heartless as to
deprive thee of thy love. I think I am right in saying that
there is not one here who would rob thee of this inestimable
treasure for all the world holds dear.</p>

<p><i>All</i> (<i>loudly</i>). Not one!</p>

<p><i>King.</i> No, I thought there wasn’t. Keep thy love, Frederic,
keep thy love. (<i>Hands her back to <span class="smcap">Frederic</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> You’re very good, I’m sure.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Well, it’s the top of the tide, and we must be off.
Farewell, Frederic. When your process of extermination
begins, let our deaths be as swift and painless as you can conveniently
make them.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I will! By the love I have for you, I swear it!
Would that you could render this extermination unnecessary
by accompanying me back to civilization!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p><i>King.</i> No, Frederic, it cannot be. I don’t think much of
our profession, but, contrasted with respectability, it is comparatively
honest. No, Frederic, I shall live and die a pirate
king.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Oh, take me with you! I cannot live if I am left
behind.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Ruth, I will be quite candid with you: you are very
dear to me, as you know, but I must be circumspect. You see,
you are considerably older than I. A lad of twenty-one usually
looks for a wife of seventeen.</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> A wife of seventeen! You will find me a wife of a
thousand!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> No, but I shall find you a wife of forty-seven, and
that is quite enough. Ruth, tell me candidly, and without
reserve&mdash;compared with other women, how are <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> I will answer you truthfully, master; I have a slight
cold, but otherwise I am quite well.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I am sorry for your cold, but I was referring rather to
your personal appearance. Compared with other women&mdash;are
you beautiful?</p>

<p><i>Ruth</i> (<i>bashfully</i>). I have been told so, dear master.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Ah, but lately?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Oh no, years and years ago.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> What do you think of yourself?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> It is a delicate question to answer, but I think I am
a fine woman.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> That is your candid opinion?</p>

<p><i>Ruth.</i> Yes, I should be deceiving you if I told you otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Thank you, Ruth; I believe you, for I am sure you
would not practise on my inexperience. I wish to do the right
thing, and if&mdash;I say if&mdash;you are really a fine woman, your age
shall be no obstacle to our union. (<i>Shakes hands with her.

hear voices! Who has ventured to approach our all but
inaccessible lair? Can it be Custom House? No, it does not
sound like Custom House.</p>

<p><i>Ruth</i> (<i>aside</i>). Confusion! it is the voices of young girls! If
he should see them I am lost.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> (<i>climbing rocky arch and looking off</i>). By all that’s
marvellous, a bevy of beautiful maidens!</p>

you?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> We are all single gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> Yes, I gathered that&mdash;anything else?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> No, nothing else.</p>

<p><i>Edith.</i> Papa, don’t believe them, they are pirates&mdash;the famous
Pirates of Penzance!</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> The Pirates of Penzance? I have often heard of them.</p>

<p><i>Mab.</i> All except this gentleman&mdash;(<i>indicating</i> <span class="smcap">Frederick)</span>&mdash;who
was a pirate once, but who is out of his indentures to-day,
and who means to lead a blameless life evermore.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> But wait a bit. I object to pirates as sons-in-law.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> We object to major-generals as fathers-in-law. But
we waive that point. We do not press it. We look over it.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Hah! an idea! (<i>Aloud.</i>) And do you mean
to say that you would deliberately rob me of these the sole
remaining props of my old age, and leave me to go through the
remainder of life unfriended, unprotected, and alone?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Well, yes, that’s the idea.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> I don’t think we quite understand one another. I ask
you, have you ever known what it is to be an orphan, and
you say “orphan.” As I understand you, you are merely repeating
the word “orphan” to show that you understand me.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> I didn’t repeat the word often.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> Pardon me, you did indeed.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> I only repeated it once.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> True, but you repeated it.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> But not often.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> Stop, I think I see where we are getting confused.
When you said “orphan,” did you mean “orphan”&mdash;a person
who has lost his parents; or often&mdash;frequently?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> Ah, I beg pardon, I see what you mean&mdash;frequently.</p>

<p><i>Mab.</i> Oh, Frederic, cannot you reconcile it with your conscience
to say something that will relieve my father’s sorrow?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I will try, dear Mabel. But why does he sit, night
after night, in this draughty old ruin?</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> Why do I sit here? To escape from the pirates’
clutches, I described myself as an orphan, and I am no orphan!
I come here to humble myself before the tombs of my ancestors,
and to implore their pardon for having brought dishonour on
the family escutcheon.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> But you forget, sir, you only bought the property a
year ago, and the stucco in your baronial hall is scarcely dry.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> Frederic, in this chapel are ancestors; you cannot
deny that. With the estate, I bought the chapel and its
contents. I don’t know whose ancestors they <i>were</i>, but I know
whose ancestors they <i>are</i>, and I shudder to think that their
descendant by purchase (if I may so describe myself) should
have brought disgrace upon what, I have no doubt, was an
unstained escutcheon.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Be comforted. Had you not acted as you did, these
reckless men would assuredly have called in the nearest clergyman,
and have married your large family on the spot.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> I thank you for your proffered solace, but it is unavailing.
At what time does your expedition march against these
scoundrels?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> At eleven; and before midnight I hope to have atoned
for my involuntary association with the pestilent scourges by
sweeping them from the face of the earth. And then, my
Mabel, you will be mine!</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> Are your devoted followers at hand?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
